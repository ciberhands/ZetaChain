# Create a Wallet in ZetaChain

To start, make sure you have an EVM-compatible wallet, like MetaMask.

Once you enter ZetaHub and connect your wallet, if you’re not already connected
to ZetaChain, you can head to any page that requires you to switch networks,
such as the Send Assets page. Once prompted to switch to ZetaChain, MetaMask
will add the ZetaChain network to your wallet.

Another way to add ZetaChain directly to your wallet is to add the network
through [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/?search=zetachain).

The ZetaChain mainnet ChainID is 7000, and the currency is ZETA. If you click
“Connect Wallet” through ChainList, you can follow your wallet’s prompts to add
ZetaChain.
