# Technical Roadmap

## Overview

ZetaChain’s mission is to serve as a platform for universal access, simplicity,
and utility across any blockchains. ZetaChain’s initial mainnet launch contains
all core functionality contemplated within ZetaChain’s proposed features,
including its EVM layer, omnichain smart contracts, and cross-chain messaging.

ZetaChain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain designed for interoperability,
supporting the creation of omnichain dApps that can span any chain, including
the Bitcoin blockchain, where all transaction, incentives, data security, and
cross-chain interaction requires ZETA tokens to function.

This document outlines the initial development directions that the protocol may
take in order to improve and add onto the core functionality of the ZetaChain
network, based on decentralized community input. All real development and
upgrades will be done through governance, and development of the ZetaChain
network is fully open-source — anybody can and should feel free to contribute to
the development of the network. The community and contributors will drive the
progress of the network.

## Potential Key Development Roadmap Pillars

![Roadmap](/img/docs/roadmap.png)

Here are the key pillars of planned areas of development.

### Chain integrations

- **Objective**: Expand the ecosystem by integrating additional blockchain
  networks.
- **Chains to Integrate**: Chains such as Solana, Filecoin, Bitcoin
  ordinals/BRC20, Cosmos ecosystem via Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC),
  various Layer 2 solutions (L2s), and others as determined by ecosystem needs.
- **Approach**: Develop and implement secure and efficient protocols for
  cross-chain interoperability. Improve framework and architecture for new chain
  integrations modularly.
- **Expected Outcome**: Increased network robustness and accessibility,
  attracting a wider user base.
- **Challenges**: Cryptography (TSS for signature schemes other than ECDSA
  secp256k1 curve), heterogeneous blockchain model/parameters/interaction
  methods, potential problems with source of information that may not be
  efficiently/robustly available from standard full-node, speed and cost of
  considerations in relation to spam deterrence.

### More dApp, Asset, and Transaction Types

- **Objective**: Facilitate the creation and operation of diverse decentralized
  applications (dApps) and assets/standards.
- **Key Features**:
  - Arbitrary omnichain smart contract messaging to/from ZetaChain.
  - ZRC-20 whitelisting automation and expanded onboarding process.
  - ZRC20-like NFT support for omnichain smart contracts.
  - BRC20/Ordinals support in Omni-chain smart contracts.
  - Standardized interactions with external chains beyond fungible tokens (ZRC20
    model)— like NFTs (”ZRC721”?)
- **Expected Outcome**: A more vibrant and versatile ecosystem supporting a
  wider range of applications and assets that applications can orchestrate.
- **Challenges:** Secure, simple, and efficient way to compose and interoperate
  different assets/contracts, standards on different chains.

### Trust Model Improvement & Security

- **Objective**: Enhance the trust model and security of the network.
- **Strategies**:
  - Shift from observation of inbound and outbound transactions to a
    proof-verification-based model.
  - Reduce reliance on the assumption of 2/3 honest observers for external
    events.
  - Improve observer/tss signer on-chain monitoring and incentives
  - Gradually increase decentralization and reduce central point of
    failures/control.
  - Improve performance and reduce cost by utilizing zero-knowledge proof for
    validating external events/computations.
- **Expected Outcome**: Reduced operational costs, enhanced network security,
  and increased trustworthiness, and reduce single point of failure points.
- **Challenges:** Incentives, decentralization, and security.

### Performance and Robustness Improvement

- **Objective**: Boost the network's efficiency and throughput.
- **Key Areas**:
  - Higher cross-chain Transactions Per Second (TPS).
  - Lower resource consumption and storage requirements for validators.
  - Increase awareness of network operation, error/exception handling and
    recovery.
  - Performance and chaos engineering tooling to battle-test new protocol
    upgrades.
- **Expected Outcome**: A faster, more efficient, and reliable blockchain
  network capable of handling increased transaction volumes.
- **Challenges:** understanding the bottleneck, scaling issues, and tradeoffs
  between performance/storage efficiency vs verifiability of the network.

### Omnichain dApp Developer Tooling, SDK, and Support

- **Objective**: Provide superior tools and support to developers.
- **Tools to Develop**:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs, Telegram Bot SDK
  - Debugging tools.
  - Cross-chain transaction simulation.
  - Explorer/observability: especially better support for complex cross-chain
    dApps to expose the cross-chain sub-tx in an easy to understand way.
- **Expected Outcome**: Easier development process, leading to an influx of
  high-quality and more novel dApps.
- **Challenges:** understanding of dApp/frontend needs; diverse requirements and
  preferences from developers.

### Taking Ownership of Key Dependencies

- **Objective**: Improve key open-source dependencies.
- **Areas of Focus**:
  - Ethermint: Enhance compatibility with Ethereum tooling, efficiency, and
    interoperability with EVM and Cosmos modules.
  - TSS-lib & Go-TSS: Improve security, performance, and support for new
    signature schemes and chains.
- **Expected Outcome**: A more reliable and versatile ecosystem, facilitating
  smoother operations and integration. A growing community of open source
  contributors for each projects.
- **Challenges:** large code base to develop and maintain, upstreaming strategy
  and working with other teams that share substantial amount of code.
