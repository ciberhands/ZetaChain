# What is ZETA?

ZetaChain's coin ZETA is used to pay the gas fees for ZetaChain smart contracts
and is additionally used to secure the PoS ZetaChain blockchain by
bonding/staking/slashing. ZETA is also at the core of ZetaChain's cross-chain
transfer, swaps, message delivery, and security. ZETA is one of the first
multi-chain coins that is natively issued across multiple chains and layers.

Users can directly move the ZETA coin from any chain A to chain B. The mechanism
is a one way peg (i.e. burning X amount on chain A and then minting X amount on
chain B).

We use our own coin ZETA to represent value cross-chain because:

- Unlike the more common two-way pegging, there is no wrapping and therefore no
  multiple representations of the same underlying asset.
- The only (native) value that can go cross-chain is via the ZETA coin, which
  reduces attack surface substantially, resulting in an easier to understand
  audit and therefore higher security. For example, we can check the total supply at
  the contract mint site.
- Users can pay ZETA for the cross-chain service that ZetaChain provides, and
  for gas on the destination chain, in a single step/bundle.
