# Fees

When interacting with smart contracts on ZetaChain, a user includes a portion of
value that is spent on gas for that transaction.

Smart contract deployments and smart contract calls require gas to run. A user
can call a zEVM contract from an external chain by ZRC-20 `deposits`, including
a contract call in the message, or connecting directly to ZetaChain and
interacting with a contract that with a contract already deployed on zEVM.

The gas market/mechanism for ZetaEVM smart contracts is based on that of
[Ethermint](https://docs.ethermint.zone/basics/gas.html) and behaves similarly
to EIP 1559 Ethereum gas fees. This gas system is built to deter malicious users
from spamming the network.

## Base Fee

ZetaChain includes a base flat fee of (example) 0.01 ZETA for any transactions,
cross-chain messaging transactions or smart contracts. This base fee is
adjustable by the network as needed to deal with network traffic and congestion,
and is burned.

_More details and breakdowns on gas fees involved with Cross-Chain Messaging and
Omnichain Smart Contracts will be written._
