# Overview

Omnichain Smart Contracts are contracts deployed on ZetaChain that can use and
orchestrate assets on connected chains, as well as on ZetaChain. With Omnichain
Smart Contracts, you are able to have a single place of logic that can maintain
the state of assets and data across all connected chains.

Omnichain Smart Contracts are ideal for more complex applications where state
management between different chains is core to the application. Some use case
examples include:

- Complex trading or DeFi applications that involve liquidity on multiple
  chains.
- Adding smart contract layer to non-smart-contract chains like Bitcoin and
  Dogecoin, or incorporating these chains/assets with other pieces of the DeFi
  ecosystem natively.
- Multichain smart-contract wallet applications like portfolio management across
  all chains.
- Leveraging existing implementations of protocols like Aave, Uniswap, Curve,
  etc. for omnichain. Since zEVM is EVM-compatible, one can build on top of
  these implementations (just as they would on Ethereum) to adapt them for
  omnichain interoperability.
