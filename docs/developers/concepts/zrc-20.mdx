# ZRC-20

ZRC-20 is a token standard integrated into ZetaChain's omnichain smart contract
platform. With ZRC-20, developers can build dApps that orchestrate native assets
on any connected chain. This makes building Omnichain DeFi protocols and dApps
such as Omnichain DEXs, Omnichain Lending, Omnichain Portfolio Management, and
anything else that involves fungible tokens on multiple chains from a single
place extremely simple — as if they were all on a single chain.

## Introduction

At a high-level, ZRC-20 tokens are an extension of the standard
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)
tokens found in the Ethereum ecosystem, ZRC-20 tokens have the added ability to
manage assets on all ZetaChain-connected chains. Any fungible token, including
Bitcoin, Dogecoin, ERC-20-equivalents on other chains, gas assets on other
chains, and so on, may be represented on ZetaChain as a ZRC-20 and orchestrated
as if it were any other fungible token (like an ERC-20).

## Interface

ZRC-20 is based on ERC-20, with three additional functions and some associated
events for integration with Cross-Chain Transactions (CCTXs) in ZetaChain.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

interface IZRC20 {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    // highlight-start
    function deposit(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function withdraw(bytes memory to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function withdrawGasFee() external view returns (address, uint256);
    // highlight-end
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
    // highlight-start
    event Deposit(bytes from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Withdrawal(address indexed from, bytes to, uint256 value);
    // highlight-end
}
```

Comparing ZRC-20 to ERC-20, there are additional external functions to deposit
and withdraw, and additional events for each of them. This makes ZRC-20
completely compatible with any applications built for ERC-20s, but with an
extremely simple interface to also function in an omnichain way.

### `deposit`

When a user sends/deposits assets to the ZetaChain TSS address
([Testnet](/reference/testnet.mdx), [Mainnet](/reference/mainnet.mdx))
on a connected chain, `deposit` is called by `zetacore` and made available to
the address that deposited. If there is data on the TX `message`, the system
contract `DepositAndCall` is called, forwarding that data in a call to
`onCrossChainCall` on the target zEVM contract. The `deposit` and
`DepositAndCall` functions are only callable by the CCTX module (`zetacore`
module) address.

This is a snippet of what the system contract looks like, where `DepositAndCall`
may be called by `zetacore` after receiving a dep osit into a TSS address
([Testnet](/reference/testnet.mdx), [Mainnet](/reference/mainnet.mdx))
managed by the ZetaChain network.

```solidity
contract SystemContract {
  address public constant FUNGIBLE_MODULE_ADDRESS;
  // ...
  constructor(address fungibleModule) {
      FUNGIBLE_MODULE_ADDRESS = fungibleModule;
  }
  // ...
  function DepositAndCall(address zrc20, uint256 amount, address target, bytes calldata message) external {
      require(msg.sender == FUNGIBLE_MODULE_ADDRESS);
      require(target != FUNGIBLE_MODULE_ADDRESS && target != address(this));
      IZRC20(zrc20).deposit(target, amount);
      zContract(target).onCrossChainCall(zrc20, amount, message);
  }
```

A contract that implements this interface may be called by a ZRC-20 deposit call.

```solidity
interface zContract {
    function onCrossChainCall(
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external;
}
```

### How to deposit and call zEVM contracts from a smart contract chain

This is an example calling from an Ethereum chain to send a transaction to the
Athens 2 TSS address in order to `deposit`.

```jsx
import { parseEther } from "@ethersproject/units";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
// This is a constant address, the TSS address of the ZetaChain network.
import { TSS_ATHENS2 } from "../systemConstants";
// Primary function definition
const main = async () => {
  // Get signer in order to write transction.
  const [signer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  // Sign a transaction that sends Ether to the TSS address.
  const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({
    to: TSS_ATHENS2,
    value: parseEther("100"),
  });
  // That's it! ZetaChain will pick up the transaction.
  console.log("Token sent. tx:", tx.hash);
};
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

If you instead wanted to do a `DepositAndCall`, you can do a similar pattern but
include data in the deposit call. This example demonstrates calling a `swap`
contract that exists on the zEVM.

```jsx title="TestDepositAndCall.js"
import { BigNumber } from "@ethersproject/bignumber";
import { parseEther } from "@ethersproject/units";
import { getAddress, isNetworkName } from "@zetachain/addresses";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { ZRC20Addresses, TSS_ATHENS2 } from "../systemConstants";
import { network } from "hardhat";
// Helper function to format data for sending a swap transaction
const getSwapData = (
  zetaSwap: string,
  destination: string,
  destinationToken: string,
  minOutput: BigNumber
) => {
  const params = getSwapParams(destination, destinationToken, minOutput);
  return zetaSwap + params.slice(2);
};
// Primary function definition
const main = async () => {
  if (!isNetworkName(network.name) || !network.name)
    throw new Error("Invalid network name");
  // Here you're choosing the target token you want the swap to output based on the network
  const destinationToken =
    network.name == "goerli"
      ? ZRC20Addresses["tMATIC"]
      : ZRC20Addresses["gETH"];
  console.log("Swapping native token...");
  // Get a signer to write your transaction
  const [signer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  // Get the correct address of the swap contract (using a helper function)
  const zetaSwap = getAddress({
    address: "zetaSwap",
    networkName: "athens",
    zetaNetwork: "athens",
  });
  // Use formatting function to get the correct data format
  const data = getSwapData(
    zetaSwap,
    signer.address,
    destinationToken,
    BigNumber.from("0")
  );
  // Sign your transaction with Swap data.
  const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({
    data,
    to: TSS_ATHENS2,
    value: parseEther("0.5"),
  });
  console.log("tx:", tx.hash);
};
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Supported assets include ZETA, native gas tokens on all connected chains
including Bitcoin as well as ERC20 tokens. ERC20 tokens must be whitelisted by
the ZetaChain network in order to allow zEVM to interact with them.

### How to deposit and call zEVM contracts from Bitcoin
**This section is important for wallet and app developers**. 

To deposit BTC into zEVM ZRC20 contract (and optionally call a smart contract),
the Bitcoin transaction must conform to this specifications: 

1. The Bitcoin transaction must have at least 2 outputs; 
2. The first output must be addressed to the TSS Bitcoin address; 
3. The second output must be a memo output, i.e. `OP_RETURN PUSH_x [DATA]`. 
   This output must be less than 80 bytes; 
4. The memo `[DATA]` is an array of bytes that encodes the recipient address
   of this deposit into ZRC20 or the smart contract on zEVM that will be invoked
   by this transaction. 
5. If the purpose of this Bitcoin transaction is to only deposit BTC into
   the BTC ZRC20 on zEVM, then the `[DATA]` should be exactly 20 bytes long, 
   consists of an Ethereum-style address.  
6. If the purpose of this Bitcoin transaction is to deposit BTC and also
   use the deposited amount to call a smart contract on zEVM, then the `[DATA]`
   field must consists of a smart contract address, and a binary message that
   will be forwarded to the said smart contract: `[DATA] = [zEVM contract address (20B)] + [arbitrary binary message]`

** TODO: show two examples of deposit and depositAndCall Bitcon transctions**

_In order to test with Bitcoin, you will need to use a wallet that allows
setting an `OP_RETURN`. Please see our wallet suggestions
[here](/reference/wallets.mdx)._


If invalid information is sent (i. e. invalid address), the assets may be
lost and not recoverable. 

In summary, a zEVM BTC transaction would look like this:

- A user sends 1 BTC on Bitcoin network to the Bitcoin TSS address
  ([Testnet](/reference/testnet.mdx), [Mainnet](/reference/mainnet.mdx)), adding a
  memo (via `OP_RETURN`) in the tx saying (colloquially) “deposit to 0x1337”.
- Upon receiving this tx, the ZetaCore state machine calls the deposit (0x1337,
  1e8) to mint and credit 0x1337 with 1 zBTC minus fees.
- If 0x1337 is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), that's it. If it's a contract,
  ZetaCore will call the `onCrossChainMessage` function sending the message that
  was specified in the `OP_RETURN` memo.

The TSS address ([Testnet](/reference/testnet.mdx),
[Mainnet](/reference/mainnet.mdx)) holds the BTC, where ownerships are
tracked inside this BTC ZRC-20 contract.

### `withdraw`

The `withdraw` function can be called by any Externally Owned Account (EOA) or
smart contract. This function is like transfer(), except that the amount is
burned, and leaves a Withdrawal() event. This event will trigger a CCTX in
`zetacore` module, which the `zetaclient` will pick up and process the outbound
tx. In this example, it uses an existing Uniswap deployment with a pool for 2
given tokens. When `onCrossChainCall` is called, it performs a swap to a target
ZRC-20 token and withdraws it to an address on a native chain.

```solidity title="TestSwap.sol"
contract ZEVMSwapApp is zContract {
  address public router02;
    constructor(address router02_) {
        router02 = router02_;
    }
    // Call this function to perform a cross-chain swap
    function onCrossChainCall(address zrc20, uint256 amount, bytes calldata message) external override {
        address targetZRC20;
        address receipient;
        uint256 minAmountOut;
        (targetZRC20, receipient,minAmountOut) = abi.decode(message, (address,address,uint256));
        address[] memory path;
        path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = zrc20;
        path[1] = targetZRC20;
        // Approve the usage of this token by router02
        IZRC20(zrc20).approve(address(router02), amount);
        // Swap for your target token
        uint256[] memory amounts = IUniswapV2Router01(router02).swapExactTokensForTokens(amount, minAmountOut, path, address(this), block.timestamp);
        // Withdraw amountto target recipient
        IZRC20(targetZRC20).withdraw(abi.encodePacked(receipient), amounts[1]);
    }
}
```

Note how simple this example is. With ~20 lines of code -- much of which is
generic code -- one is able to create a cross-chain swap dApp where users can
trade native assets for other native assets. `withdraw` may be used in any
situation where a user needs to get assets back onto one's native wallet, while
`deposit` from above allows you to deposit and orchestrate any assets via zEVM
smart contract calls. Together, these simple functions unlock powerful yet
simple solutions for omnichain application building.

## Building on ZRC-20

With ZRC-20, developers have the power to build seamless, omnichain applications
while also leveraging the entire EVM ecosystem to-date and plethora of
contracts/protocols to build on top of. To start building with ZRC-20, check out
some quickstart examples **here**.
