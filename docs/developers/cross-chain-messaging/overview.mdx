# Cross-Chain Messaging

Cross-chain messaging lets you send messages from any connected chain to any
connected chain, including ZetaChain. These make the most sense for applications
that generally need minimal logic or state to maintain across all chains, and
where data that needs to be passed between different chains only needs to be
transferred one way. You can send any data or value through messaging, without
the need for new wrapped assets.
