# Cross-Chain Messaging

## Cross-Chain Messaging

Cross-chain messaging lets you send messages from any connected chain to any
connected chain, including ZetaChain. Cross-chain messaging makes the most sense
for applications that generally need minimal logic or state to maintain across
all chains, and where data that needs only to be passed between different chains
one way.

A good example of this is an application that needs only to call a contract or
send value to an address on a different chain. After the message is received and
processed on the destination, the application ideally doesn't have to broadcast
anything back to synchronize state for anything, and the sender doesn't care
about the results.

Cross-chain messaging works to build a variety of applications and primitives
such as:

- Omnichain NFTs that can be sent between different chains, and that don't need
  to know about the state of the collection on other chains
- “Simple” swap or bridge apps that use liquidity pools on existing chains
- Proving ownership of NFTs or simple action-calls to a different chain
