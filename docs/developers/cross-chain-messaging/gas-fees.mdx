# Cross-Chain Messaging Fees

A user (wallet, contract) must pay fees in order to send data and value across
chains through ZetaChain. A user pays for fees by sending ZETA (and message
data) on a connected chain to a Connector contract. This ZETA is used to pay
validators/stakers/ecosystem pools, as well as for paying the gas on the
destination. To a user, this is all bundled into a single transaction.

When sending a cross-chain message you're paying two types of fees:

- Outbound gas fee: calculated dynamically based on the gas prices for the
  destination chain, the gas limit supplied by the user and the token prices on
  the liquidity pools on ZetaChain.
- Protocol fee: currently, a fixed value defined in the ZetaChain source code.

### Current Cross-Chain Messaging Fees

In the table below you can see the current fees. The fees are defined in ZETA
tokens and are calculated for the destination chain (the chain where the message
is sent to). The fees are calculated with the gas limit of 500000.

<Fees type="messaging" />

To calculate fees for a different gas limit, please, check out the `fees`
command in the smart-contract
[template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template):

## Different Approaches to Paying the Fees

When you write a smart contract that uses cross chain messages this contract
needs to pay fees in ZETA for every cross chain transaction. There are several
ways to handle this.

### Sending ZETA to the Connector

In your cross-chain messaging contract approve `zetaValueAndGas` amount of ZETA
tokens to the connector and then transfer them to the connector contract.

The main disadvantage with this approach is that the user must approve your
contract before and they have to have enough ZETA in his wallet.

```solidity
function sendMessage(uint256 destinationChainId, bytes calldata destinationAddress, uint256 zetaValueAndGas) external {
    if (zetaValueAndGas == 0) revert InvalidZetaValueAndGas();

    bool success1 = ZetaEth(zetaToken).approve(address(connector), zetaValueAndGas);
    bool success2 = ZetaEth(zetaToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), zetaValueAndGas);
    if (!(success1 && success2)) revert ErrorTransferringZeta();

    connector.send(
        ZetaInterfaces.SendInput({
            destinationChainId: destinationChainId,
            destinationAddress: destinationAddress,
            destinationGasLimit: 300000,
            message: abi.encode(),
            zetaValueAndGas: zetaValueAndGas,
            zetaParams: abi.encode("")
        })
    );
}
```

### Pay With ZETA From the Contract

You can add ZETA tokens to the contract and the contract will use these tokens
when sending cross chain messages.

This is easier for end-users, because they don't have to think about using ZETA
tokens, but it's more complex for the contract developer because they have to
ensure that the contract has enough ZETA tokens.

```solidity
function sendMessage(uint256 destinationChainId, bytes calldata destinationAddress) external {
    bool success1 = ZetaEth(zetaToken).approve(address(connector), ZETA_GAS);
    if (!success1) revert ErrorApprovingZeta();

    connector.send(
        ZetaInterfaces.SendInput({
            destinationChainId: destinationChainId,
            destinationAddress: destinationAddress,
            destinationGasLimit: 300000,
            message: abi.encode(),
            zetaValueAndGas: ZETA_GAS,
            zetaParams: abi.encode("")
        })
    );
}
```

### Pay With Any Token and Swap to ZETA

Your contract can accept any token and swap it to ZETA internally.

This approach is more complex, because you need to add a swap logic to your
contract and take market price fluctuations into account. But it's more
convenient for end-users, because they can use any token to pay for cross chain
messages without even knowing that ZETA is being used under the hood.

To make it eaier you can use ZetaConsumer's `getZetaFromEth` to swap any token
to ZETA.

```solidity
function sendMessage(uint256 destinationChainId, bytes calldata destinationAddress) external payable{
    uint256 crossChainGas = 2 * (10 ** 18);
    uint256 zetaValueAndGas = _zetaConsumer.getZetaFromEth{value: msg.value}(address(this), crossChainGas);
    bool success1 = ZetaEth(zetaToken).approve(address(connector), zetaValueAndGas);
    if (!success1) revert ErrorApprovingZeta();

    connector.send(
        ZetaInterfaces.SendInput({
            destinationChainId: destinationChainId,
            destinationAddress: destinationAddress,
            destinationGasLimit: 300000,
            message: abi.encode(),
            zetaValueAndGas: zetaValueAndGas,
            zetaParams: abi.encode("")
        })
    );
}
```

[ZetaTokenConsumer](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/evm/interfaces/ZetaInterfaces.sol)
is an interface with several implementations that handles all the logic you need
to swap ZETA from/to another token. Right now we have three implementations
([Uniswap V2](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/evm/tools/ZetaTokenConsumerUniV2.strategy.sol),
[Uniswap V3](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/evm/tools/ZetaTokenConsumerUniV3.strategy.sol),
and
[Trident](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/evm/tools/ZetaTokenConsumerTrident.strategy.sol))
using different DEX. You can include it in your contract and just call the
appropriate method.
