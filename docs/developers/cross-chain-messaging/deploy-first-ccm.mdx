# Deploy an Omnichain NFT

## Overview

ZetaChain offers two types of contracts:
[Cross Chain Messaging](/developers/cross-chain-messaging/overview.mdx)
Contracts (CCM) and [zEVM](/developers/omnichain/zeta-evm.mdx) Contracts
(Omnichain Smart Contracts).

This tutorial specifically focuses on deploying a CCM-based Omnichain NFT. This
NFT may be transferred between different chains seamlessly by passing messages
between blockchains.

## Prerequisites/Setup

This tutorial will use the `zetachain` public repository as a starting point.
This repository contains examples and references for development with ZetaChain.
You have two options for configuring your local system

### Option 1: Use Docker

1. Make sure your machine has `docker` installed:
   [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Download the zetachain docker image:
   `docker pull ghcr.io/zeta-chain/zetachain`
3. Open a shell using this image: `docker run -it zetachain`
4. Create your wallet and .env files with this command: `yarn setup-tutorial`
5. Proceed to the
   [Deploying an Omnichain Smart Contract on zEVM](#Deploying-an-Omnichain-Smart-Contract-on-zEVM)
   section below

### Option 2: Configure Your Local System Manually

1. Make sure your machine has `git` installed:
   [Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. Install [Node.js 16.30 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (other
   versions may, but are not guaranteed to work).
3. Install `yarn` (make sure NPM has the right permissions to add global
   packages): `npm i -g yarn`
4. Clone the `zetachain` repository to your machine

   ```jsx
   git clone git@github.com:zeta-chain/zetachain.git
   cd zetachain
   ```

5. Install the dependencies:

   `yarn`

6. From the root folder, compile the contracts:

   `yarn compile`

   This will compile all the contracts in the repository for you so that you can
   try deploying them. You can compile these later if you need to edit anything.

7. You should have an EVM-compatible wallet (not necessarily for this tutorial,
   but in general). We recommend Metamask as an easy default, but also XDEFI if
   you're planning on developing dApps that incorporate Bitcoin.

## Deploying a Cross Chain NFT (Cross-Chain Messaging)

To understand how cross chain messaging works, we will deploy a cross chain NFT
on Goerli and BSC (also called BNB Chain). The NFT uses ZetaChain's cross-chain
messaging to “burn” and “mint” the NFT in order to transfer it across chains
while still remaining unique. While normal NFTs are bound to the chain they're
minted on, these NFTs can move and interact with data/assets on any blockchain.

1. First, we need to set up our local environment by running `yarn install` in
   the project's root directory.
2. Next, we need to set up our environment variables by updating, or creating if
   doesn't exists, the `.env` file in `zetachain/packages/example-contracts`.
   You can do this manually if you have a development wallet you want to use but
   the easiest option is to use our built in script `yarn setup-tutorial` to
   create a new wallet and configure the .env files. Your .env file should look
   like this.

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR-KEY-HERE>
ZETA_NETWORK=athens
EXECUTE_PROGRAMMATICALLY=true
```

Let's go over each variable in this file:

    `ZETA_NETWORK=athens` refers to the version of the ZetaChain you will use, which determines the connector address used to communicate with ZetaChain. Athens is our public testnet.

    `EXECUTE_PROGRAMMATICALLY=true` is used to call other scripts while only executing the caller and importing the other.

    `PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the wallet you want to use to deploy the contract.

3. When deploying a CCM contract, there are two steps involved. First, we need
   to deploy the contracts on each chain we want to use. Second, we need to set
   up each contract so they can recognize each other's addresses.

   By the end of this tutorial you will have:

   - Deployed the contract on Goerli
   - Deployed the contract on BSC
   - Set up each contract to communicate with each other

4. We have a logic in place that writes the deployed address to a JSON file in
   the addresses package. You will find the file at
   `packages/addresses/src/addresses.athens.json` and it is indexed by chain,
   with each attribute being a contract name. In this example, the contract name
   is `crossChainNft`. To deploy to Goerli, go to the
   `packages/example-contracts/` directory and you will find several scripts.
   Take a look at
   `packages/example-contracts/scripts/cross-chain-warriors/deploy.ts`. This
   script deploys a new instance of CrossChainWarriors (a demo NFT) and mints
   the first one to the deployer. We will use Hardhat, a powerful tool for
   working with smart contracts, to run this script. The command to run the
   script is as follows:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/cross-chain-warriors/deploy.ts --network goerli
   ```
   The `--network goerli` flag specifies the blockchain network where the
   deployment will take place. It is important to note that this command will be
   executed using the private key previously set up, so make sure there are
   sufficient funds in the chosen network to perform the deployment.
5. To deploy the contract, run the following command:
   `npx hardhat run scripts/cross-chain-warriors/deploy.ts`. This Hardhat
   command will execute the script and add the deployer information, etc. Once
   the command is executed, you can verify that the address file has been
   updated in your Git changes. Repeat the command using the
   `--network "bsc-testnet"` flag.
6. Next, update the data to allow the contract to communicate with each other by
   using the following command:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/cross-chain-warriors/set-cross-chain-data.ts --network goerli
   ```
   The script will perform the following steps:
   1. Retrieve the contract address on the current chain.
   2. Retrieve the contract address on the opposite chain (for testing purposes,
      we have defined this concept in our repository and Goerli is opposite to
      BSC, but you can choose any chain you desire).
   3. Call the method `crossChainWarriorsContract.setInteractorByChainId` with
      two parameters: the first is the destination chain, and the second is the
      address of the contract on that chain. Please note that you will need to
      run this script twice, once on each chain. If you are on a non-unix
      command line (Windows), please add `ZETA_NETWORK=athens` and
      `EXECUTE_PROGRAMMATICALLY=true` to your environment (e. g.
      `set ZETA_NETWORK=athens`), and rerun the commands.

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your first cross-chain NFT! This
NFT can be transferred between chains using ZetaChain's cross-chain messaging
functionality. This way, a unique asset like this NFT can span and be used
across all blockchains. You can read the actual contract you've deployed in the
`packages/example-contracts/contracts/cross-chain-warriors/CrossChainWarriors.sol`
file. If you're building on top of this, you can edit the file and redeploy
using the same steps as above.
