# ERC-20 on ZetaChain

ZetaChain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20) token
contracts can be deployed to ZetaChain permissionlessly.

:::note

An ERC-20 token deployed to ZetaChain **does not** have the properties of
[ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20), specifically, it can't be withdrawn from
ZetaChain to a connected chain.
