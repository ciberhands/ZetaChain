# ZetaScan

ZetaScan is a blockchain explorer maintained by the ZetaChain team. You can view
recent ZetaChain transactions and track the status of cross-chain transactions
end-to-end. Check it out: https://explorer.zetachain.com.

## Verifying Smart Contracts

ZetaScan allows you to verify the source code of deployed smart contracts and
interact with them directly from the explorer.

To verify a smart contract, navigate to the contract's page and click the
"Verify & Publish" button. You will need to provide the contract's source code
and metadata file.

Let's compile, deploy and verify one of the example contracts as an example.

Clone the example contracts repository and navigate to the withdraw contract:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts
cd example-contracts/withdraw
```

Install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Clear the cache and artifacts, then compile the contract:

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

Create a wallet:

```
npx hardhat account --save
```

Request testnet ZETA tokens:

```
npx hardhat faucet
```

Deploy the compiled contract to ZetaChain's testnet:

```
npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet
```

Follow the link in the output to view the contract on ZetaScan. Please, note
that it may take a few minutes for the contract to appear on ZetaScan.

Click the "Verify & Publish" button. You will need to provide the contract's
source code and metadata file.

The source code of the contract is contained in the `contracts/Withdraw.sol`
file. Drag the file into the drop zone in ZetaScan.

The metadata is contained in the `artifacts/build-info` directory. Drag the JSON
file into the drop zone in ZetaScan as well.

After both the source code and metadata have been uploaded, click the "Verify &
Publish" button. If your contract imports other contracts, you may see a pop-up
window asking you to select which contract you want to verify.

Select "Withdraw" and click "Verify again".

Congratulations! Your contract is now verified on ZetaScan. You can now interact
with it directly from the explorer.
