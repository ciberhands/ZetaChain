# Get Testnet ZETA (faucet)

## What is ZETA?

ZETA is a token used to deploy and call smart contracts on ZetaChain, and to
transact data and value across chains (through messaging). For ZetaChain's
testnet network, they use the same ZETA that lives on connected testnet
networks. With ZetaChain's mainnet launch, ZETA will be traded and transacted
across all connected chains.

You can view the addresses on respective chains [here](/reference/testnet).
Check out [Omnichain Smart Contacts](/developers/overview) for more information
about developing smart contracts on ZetaChain, where ZETA is used for gas fees.
Check out the [Connector docs](/developers/cross-chain-messaging/connector) for
information on how to send ZETA as well as any data or value via ZetaChain.

## How to get testnet ZETA

Please note that testnet ZETA has no monetary value and is solely intended for
testing and development purposes. Therefore, if you're not a developer, there's
no need for you to acquire testnet ZETA.

To obtain testnet ZETA for development purposes, please follow the instructions
provided below.

### Using the ZetaChain CLI faucet

The easiest way to get testnet ZETA is to use the ZetaChain CLI faucet. You can
install the CLI by following the instructions (you may need `sudo` priveleges):

```
npm install -g @zetachain/faucet-cli@athens3
```

Once installed, you can use the faucet to get ZETA tokens on any EVM-compatible
network. For example, to get ZETA on the Goerli testnet, you can run:

```
zetafaucet --drip --address 0x4bB9089ee3B86e97b171838205483362966f9dE8 --chain goerli_testnet
```

You will be prompted to authenticate with your GitHub account to use the faucet.

Please note that using this faucet you can get only ZETA tokens, not the native
gas assets of the respective networks. If you need more gas assets, you can use
the other faucets listed below.

### Swapping Native Gas Assets for ZETA

If you already have some native gas assets on the respective testnet networks,
you can swap them for ZETA tokens using Uniswap on Goerli and Mumbai and Pancake
Swap on BSC testnet.

For example, to swap gETH for ZETA do the following:

- Go to [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
- Press "Connect" to connect your wallet
- Switch to the **Goerli testnet** in your wallet (please, make sure you're on
  the testnet network before proceeding)
- Select ETH as the input token
- Press "Select token"
- Add ZETA token by pasting the `zetaToken` contract address from the
  [testnet addresses](/reference/testnet) page into the input field
- Enter amount and press "Swap"

Optionally, import `zetaToken` contract address into your wallet to see your
ZETA balance.

After receiving ZETA tokens on Goerli, you can either switch to another testnet
network (like Mumbai or BSC testnet) to swap ZETA there, or use the built-in
[`send-zeta`](/developers/tokens) command to transfer ZETA between connected
networks.

### Using a Hardhat template

If you're using [a Hardhat template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template),
you can get ZETA tokens by running the following command:

```
npx hardhat faucet --chain goerli_testnet
```

Under the hood this command uses the ZetaChain CLI faucet.

### Using the Faucet on Discord

You can also get testnet ZETA on the
[ZetaChain Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/zetachain). To do so,
please follow the instructions provided in the `#zeta-faucet-athens-3` channel.

## Getting Additional Testnet Gas Assets

If you need more gas assets for the respective testnet networks to transact
with, you can try the following faucets:

- [Paradigm Faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz) (Goerli, Polygon Mumbai, etc.)
- [Goerli Proof of Work Faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/) (Goerli)
- [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) (Polygon Mumbai)
- [Binance Smart Chain Faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart) (BSC
  Testnet)
- [coinfaucet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/) (Testnet BTC)
- [testnet-faucet](https://testnet-faucet.com/btc-testnet/) (Testnet BTC)
- [bitcoinfaucet](https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/) (Testnet BTC)
