# Get Testnet ZETA (faucet)

## What is ZETA?

ZETA is a token used to deploy and call smart contracts on ZetaChain, and to
transact data and value across chains (through messaging). For ZetaChain's
testnet network, they use the same ZETA that lives on connected testnet
networks. With ZetaChain's mainnet launch, ZETA will be traded and transacted
across all connected chains.

You can view the addresses on respective chains [here](/reference/testnet.mdx).
Check out [Omnichain Smart Contacts](/developers/overview.mdx) for more
information about developing smart contracts on ZetaChain, where ZETA is used
for gas fees. Check out the
[Connector docs](/developers/cross-chain-messaging/connector) for information on
how to send ZETA as well as any data or value via ZetaChain.

## How to get testnet ZETA

Please note that testnet ZETA has no monetary value and is solely intended for
testing and development purposes. Therefore, if you're not a developer, there's
no need for you to acquire testnet ZETA.

To obtain testnet ZETA for development purposes, please follow the instructions
provided below.

### Using the ZetaChain CLI faucet

The easiest way to get testnet ZETA is to use the ZetaChain CLI faucet. You can
install the CLI by following the instructions (you may need `sudo` priveleges):

```bash
npm install -g @zetachain/faucet-cli@athens3
```

Once installed, you can use the faucet to get ZETA tokens on any EVM-compatible
network. For example, to get ZETA on the Goerli testnet, you can run:

```bash
zetafaucet --drip --address 0x4bB9089ee3B86e97b171838205483362966f9dE8 --chain goerli_testnet
```

You will be prompted to authenticate with your Github account to use the faucet.

Please note that using this faucet you can get only ZETA tokens, not the native
gas assets of the respective networks. If you need more gas assets, you can use
the other faucets listed below.

### Using a Hardhat template

If you're using [a Hardhat template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template),
you can get ZETA tokens by running the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat faucet --chain goerli
```

Under the hood this command uses the ZetaChain CLI faucet.

## Getting Additional Testnet Gas Assets

with, you can try the following faucets:
