# Get Testnet ZETA (faucet)

## What is ZETA?

ZETA is a token used to deploy and call smart contracts on ZetaChain, and to
transact data and value across chains (through messaging). For ZetaChain's
Athens network, they use the same ZETA that lives on connected testnet networks.
With ZetaChain's Mainnet launch, ZETA will be traded and transacted across all
connected chains.

You can view the addresses on respective chains [here](/reference/testnet.mdx).
Check out [Omnichain Smart Contacts](/developers/overview.mdx) for more
information about developing smart contracts on ZetaChain, where ZETA is used
for gas fees. Check out the
[Connector docs](/developers/cross-chain-messaging/connector.mdx) for
information on how to send ZETA as well as any data or value via ZetaChain.

## How to get testnet ZETA

:::note

Please note that testnet ZETA has no monetary value and is solely intended for
testing and development purposes. Therefore, if you're not a developer, there's
no need for you to acquire testnet ZETA.

:::

### Using the ZetaChain CLI faucet

The easiest way to get testnet ZETA is to use the ZetaChain CLI faucet. You can
install the CLI by following the instructions (you may need `sudo` priveleges):

```bash
npm install -g @zetachain/faucet-cli
```

Once installed, you can use the faucet to get ZETA tokens on any EVM-compatible
network. For example, to get ZETA on the Goerli testnet, you can run:

```bash
zetafaucet --drip --address 0x4bB9089ee3B86e97b171838205483362966f9dE8 --chain goerli
```

You will be prompted to authenticate with your Github account to use the faucet.

Please note that using this faucet you can get only ZETA tokens, not the native
gas assets of the respective networks. If you need more gas assets, you can use
the other faucets listed below.

### Using a Hardhat template

If you're using [a Hardhat template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template),
you can get ZETA tokens by running the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat faucet --chain goerli
```

Under the hood this command uses the ZetaChain CLI faucet.

### On Discord

In our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kjQBqcZtnh) you can acquire ZETA via
the #zeta-faucet channel. To get some ZETA, use the command
`zeta faucet drip [address]` in #zeta-faucet, replacing `[address]` with your
EVM-compatible address. As we add support for additional chains, we'll allow you
to get ZETA for various other networks and addresses. The faucet will also drip
some native gas assets so you can get started transacting immediately!

After requesting ZETA from the bot, you will receive ZETA on each connected
chain. With this ZETA in your wallets, you have all you need to start building
on ZetaChain!

Note that this testnet ZETA has no monetary value, and is only needed for
testing and development purposes.

with, you can try the following faucets:
