# Overview

ZetaChain can be interacted with from external chains and directly with the
ZetaEVM.

## EVM Wallets

To interact with ZetaChain from external chains, and to interact with the
[ZetaEVM](/developers/omnichain/zeta-evm.mdx) itself, you should use an
EVM-compatible wallet.

We suggest the following wallets (although there are plenty of alternatives!):

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io)
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

## Bitcoin Wallets

In order to interact with ZetaChain from Bitcoin, you'll need a wallet that can
include a "memo" or `OP_RETURN` in the transactions. This is used to deposit
funds and call contracts on the ZetaEVM (see
[ZRC-20](/developers/omnichain/zeta-evm.mdx) docs for more details on this).

We suggest using the following for testing Bitcoin transactions (although there
are alternatives if you prefer other wallets!):

- [XDEFI Wallet](https://xdefi.io)

## Cosmos Wallets

### Keplr Wallet

Keplr is a popular extension and mobile wallet for Cosmos-based chains. It can
be used to interact with ZetaChain. Learn more about Keplr: https://keplr.app/
