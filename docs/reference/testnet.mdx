# ZetaChain Testnet

ZetaChain's testnet is live with the latest features, it will be undergoing
active upgrades and development. Periodically, this network may undergo stress
testing affecting the network's availability. This network is poised to
eventually become the primary testnet for all ZetaChain development. If you are
deploying and testing dApps moving forward, you should deploy and test them
here.

For a list of RPC endpoints, refer to the [API endpoints page](/reference/api).

## Transition from Athens-2 to Athens-3

Apps that were deployed to Athens-2 are or will transition to Athens-3 as a
long-term testnet. If you need to upgrade your wallet to use this new network
instead of Athens-2, please follow these instructions.

1. In your wallet, remove the ZetaChain network that you are currently using.

- For Metamask, you can use this tutorial:
  https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4502810252059-How-to-remove-networks
- For Coinbase Wallet, go to Settings > Networks > Custom, and find your current
  ZetaChain network. At the bottom of this networkâ€™s page, press the Delete
  button.

2. Add the new network. Network information for the testnet looks like this:

| Network Name    | ZetaChain Athens-3 Testnet                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| RPC URL         | https://zetachain-athens-evm.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public |
| Currency Symbol | aZETA                                                      |
| Block Explorer  | https://zetachain-athens-3.blockscout.com/                 |
| Chain ID        | 7001                                                       |

> By moving to the new RPC/network, you will not keep assets or any data from
> Athens-2. No assets on any testnet should be worth any value, but if you want
> to keep anything, you can transfer it to a different chain from ZetaChain.
