ZetaChain's testnet is live with the latest features, it will be undergoing
active upgrades and development. Periodically, this network may undergo stress
testing affecting the network's availability. This network is poised to
eventually become the primary testnet for all ZetaChain development. If you are
deploying and testing dApps moving forward, you should deploy and test them
