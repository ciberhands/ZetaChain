# Setting up Cosmovisor

Cosmovisor is an optional process supervisor for ZetaChain. It is a wrapper
around the `zetacored` binary that allows for automatic restarts automatic
upgrades of the ZetaChain binary. It is a fork of the
[CosmosVisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/cosmovisor) tool.

You can use a prebuilt `Cosmovisor` binary or build it yourself from source.

## Installing Cosmovisor

### Building From Source

You need to have Go 1.19 and other dependencies first but those are outside the
scope of this document. If you are uncomfortable building the binary from source
code we recommend using a prebuilt binary as shown in the next step.

You can build from source by cloning the repository and running the following
commands.

```
go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.5.0
mv $GOPATH/bin/zetavisor /usr/local/bin/cosmovisor
```

### Download Cosmovisor Binary

Download the Binary for your system architecture from the following links and
place it in your $PATH
amd64: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/download/cosmovisor%2Fv1.5.0/cosmovisor-v1.5.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
arm64: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/download/cosmovisor%2Fv1.5.0/cosmovisor-v1.5.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz

This example assumes you are using amd64 architecture. If you are using arm64
replace amd64 with arm64 in the commands below.

```bash
wget https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/download/cosmovisor%2Fv1.5.0/cosmovisor-v1.5.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv cosmovisor-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cosmovisor
```

## Setting up Cosmovisor

### Create `Cosmovisor` Directories

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zetacored/config
mkdir -p ~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir -p ~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/upgrades

```

### Setup `Cosmovisor` systemd service

In this example we'll run Cosmovisor as a systemd service. You can also run it as
a docker container or as a standalone process. The environment variables are
explained in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section at the
end of this document.

Create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/cosmovisor.service` with the following
contents. Make sure to change the `User` and `/home/zetachain/` fields to the
user you want to run the service as.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Cosmovisor ZetaChain Service
After=multi-user.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/zetachain/.zetacored/cosmovisor
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=/home/zetachain/.zetacored"
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=zetacored"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_DATA_BACKUP_DIR=/home/zetachain/.zetacored"
Environment="CLIENT_DAEMON_NAME=zetaclientd"
Environment="CLIENT_SKIP_UPGRADE=false"
Environment="CLIENT_START_PROCESS=false"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=600
User=zetachain
LimitNOFILE=262144
ExecStart=cosmovisor start --home /home/zetachain/.zetacored/ --log_format json  --moniker <YOUR_NODE_NAME_HERE>
```

## Install the `zetacored` Binary

### Download `zetacored` Binary

Download the latest `zetacored` binary for your system architecture from the following
links and place it in the `cosmovisor/genesis/bin/` directory. This example
assumes you are using ubuntu 22 on amd64 architecture. You may need to make
adjustments for your system.

```bash
wget https://zetachain-external-files.s3.amazonaws.com/binaries/athens3/latest/zetacored-ubuntu-22-amd64
mv zetacored-ubuntu-22-amd64 ~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/zetacored
chmod +x ~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/zetacored

```

### Install ZetaChain Configuration Files

ZetaChain configuration files for the Athens3 Testnet can be downloaded from the [Athens3 Github
Repo](https://github.com/zeta-chain/network-athens3/tree/main/network_files/config)

Install them as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/network-athens3
cp network-athens3/network_files/config/* ~/.zetacored/config/
```

## Starting Cosmovisor

### State Sync

You may choose to sync the state of your node from a snapshot. This will speed
up the time it takes to sync your node. Instructions for syncing from a snapshot
can be found
[here](https://docs.zetachain.io/docs/running-a-full-node#state-sync).

### Start the `Cosmovisor` Service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cosmovisor
sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```

### Check the `Cosmovisor` Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status cosmovisor
```

### Check the `cosmovisor` Logs

```bash
journalctl -u cosmovisor -f
```

## Monitoring

In a production environment we recommend monitoring the node resources (CPU
load, Memory Usage, Disk usage and Disk IO) for any performance degradation.

ZetaChain Core generates a log that can be monitored for errors and used for
troubleshooting. If you install Zetacore as a Systemd service using the
instructions above you can view this log with `journalctl -o cat -f -u zetacored`.

Prometheus can be enabled to serve metrics which can be consumed by Prometheus
collector(s). Telemetry include Prometheus metrics can be enabled in the
app.toml file. See the [CosmosSDK Telemetry
Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/core/telemetry.html) for more
information.

## Cosmovisor Environment Variables

More Information About Cosmovisor
For more detailed information about Cosmosvisor you can visit the Cosmos Documentation Here
https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor

- `DAEMON_NAME`

  - The name of the binary itself (e.g. gaiad, regend, simd, etc.).

- `DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES` (optional)

  - If set to true, enables auto-downloading of new binaries (for security
    reasons, this is intended for full nodes rather than validators). By
    default, Cosmovisor will not auto-download new binaries.

- `DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE` (optional, default = true)

  - If true, restarts the subprocess with the same command-line arguments and
    flags (but with the new binary) after a successful upgrade. Otherwise
    (false), Cosmovisor stops running after an upgrade and requires the system
    administrator to manually restart it. Note that restart is only after the
    upgrade and does not auto-restart the subprocess after an error occurs.

- `DAEMON_DATA_BACKUP_DIR`

  - Option to set a custom backup directory. If not set, DAEMON_HOME is used.

- `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP` (defaults to false)
  - If set to true, upgrades directly without performing a backup. Otherwise
    (false, default), backs up the data before trying the upgrade. The default
    value of false is useful and recommended in case of failures and when a
    backup is needed to rollback. We recommend using the default backup option
    UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=false.
- `CLIENT_DAEMON_NAME`
  - Top level config for name of core binary
- `AllowDownloadBinaries`
  - True : Top level config to allow download during an upgrade
  - False : Top Level config to stop the above
- `CLIENT_SKIP_UPGRADE`
  - True :
    - Skips upgrade for the client (Does not replace binary)
      - Note Upgrade includes download also
    - Does not kill the client process at upgrade height
    - Does not start the client after upgrade
    - Use this to completely ignore zetaclient .
  - False: Replaces the client binary at the correct height
- `CLIENT_START_PROCESS`
  - True : Starts zetaclientd
  - False : Does not start zetaclientd
  - Note
    - Both `RestartAfterUpgrade` and `StartClientProcess` need to be `true`
      for this to work
    - `SkipClientUpgrade` needs to be `false` and `StartClientProcess` needs
      to be `true` for this to work
  - Use this to tune upgrade process
    - Example : `SkipClientUpgrade` : false && `StartClientProcess` false
      - Will do the upgrade , replace binaries etc but starting the client
        needs to be handled separately
      - Note the client will still be killed at the upgrade height , and
        new binaries will be copied to the correct location (Dowloaded if
        allowed)
