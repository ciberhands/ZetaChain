# Running a Full Node

This document outlines the process for running a full ZetaChain node. It is
intended for those who are familiar with the Linux operating system and the
command line interface.

Please refer to [Technical Requirements](/validators/requirements) for more
details on the technical requirements for running a ZetaChain node.

## Getting Started

### Set Limits on Open Files and Number of Processes

To better manage the resources of your nodes, we recommend setting some limits
on the maximum number of open file descriptors (nofile) and maximum number of
processes (nproc).

Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` to include or modify the following parameters:

```
*       soft    nproc   262144
*       hard    nproc   262144
*       soft    nofile  262144
*       hard    nofile  262144
```

Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include the following:

```
fs.file-max=262144
```

### Create _zetachain_ User Account

We recommend running ZetaChain binary files with a user account rather than as
root.

```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/bash zetachain
```

### Create ZetaChain Directory Structure

This is needed to store ZetaChain binary and configuration files.

```bash
sudo su zetachain
mkdir -p /home/zetachain/.zetacored/bin
mkdir /home/zetachain/.zetacored/config
```

### Download and Install the zetacored binary

Binaries are built based on OS version and CPU architecture. You can download the latest binaries from our [ZetaChain Node GitHub Repo](https://github.com/zeta-chain/node/releases)


Install it in your PATH:

```
/usr/local/bin/zetacored
```

## General Settings

### Install ZetaChain Configuration Files

ZetaChain configuration files can be downloaded from the
[Athens3 Github Repo](https://github.com/zeta-chain/network-athens3/tree/main/network_files/config)

Install it as follows:

```
/home/zetachain/.zetacored/config/app.toml
/home/zetachain/.zetacored/config/client.toml
/home/zetachain/.zetacored/config/config.toml
/home/zetachain/.zetacored/config/genesis.json
```

### Create a Systemd Unit File

We recommend using Systemd to start and stop ZetaChain binary files and view the
logs. You can create a Systemd unit file at the following location
`/etc/systemd/system/zetacored.service`:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Zetacored Service
After=multi-user.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=90
User=zetachain
LimitNOFILE=262144
ExecStart=zetacored start --home /home/zetachain/.zetacored/ --log_format json  --log_level info --moniker <YOUR_NODE_NAME_HERE>
```

Then start the service with `systemctl start zetacored`.

You can view the logs with `journalctl -o cat -f -u zetacored`.

## CLI

ZetaChain Core is built with the Cosmos SDK. There is an `â€”help` flag that can
be used with any subcommand to learn its use and syntax.

```bash
zetacored --help
```

## Monitoring

In a production environment we recommend monitoring the node resources (CPU
load, Memory Usage, Disk usage and Disk IO) for any performance degradation.

ZetaChain Core generates a log that can be monitored for errors and used for
troubleshooting. If you install Zetacore as a Systemd service using the
instructions above you can view this log with
`journalctl -o cat -f -u zetacored`.

Prometheus can be enabled to serve metrics which can be consumed by Prometheus
collector(s). Telemetry include Prometheus metrics can be enabled in the
app.toml file. See the
[CosmosSDK Telemetry Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/core/telemetry.html)
for more information.

# Syncing from a StateSync node

## Testnet

| Region                      | IP             |
| :-------------------------- | :------------- |
| N. Virginia (US East)       | 52.3.196.71    |
| Oregon (US West)            | 54.187.106.246 |
| Ireland (EU West)           | 176.34.112.136 |
| Singapore (APAC South East) | 3.0.80.230     |

## Mainnet

| Region                      | IP  |
| :-------------------------- | :-- |
| N. Virginia (US East)       | TBD |
| Oregon (US West)            | TBD |
| Ireland (EU West)           | TBD |
| Singapore (APAC South East) | TBD |

Use the state sync node closer your node. Run the following command to collect
the `latest block height` and `latest block hash`:

```bash
curl -s http://<closest StateSync IP>:26657/block | jq -r '.result.block.header.height + "\n" + .result.block_id.hash'
```

Example Output

```
$ curl -s http://52.3.196.71:26657/block | jq -r '.result.block.header.height + "\n" + .result.block_id.hash'
120659
2554175FC58E5AC01723903971D1153BC1AF5341A51E5EABC22904730085B3CA
```

Use the return values to edit the following variables in
`/home/zetachain/.zetacored/config/config.toml`

```bash
[statesync]
# State sync rapidly bootstraps a new node by discovering, fetching, and restoring a state machine
# snapshot from peers instead of fetching and replaying historical blocks. Requires some peers in
# the network to take and serve state machine snapshots. State sync is not attempted if the node
# has any local state (LastBlockHeight > 0). The node will have a truncated block history,
# starting from the height of the snapshot.
enable = true

# RPC servers (comma-separated) for light client verification of the synced state machine and
# retrieval of state data for node bootstrapping. Also needs a trusted height and corresponding
# header hash obtained from a trusted source, and a period during which validators can be trusted.
#
# For Cosmos SDK-based chains, trust_period should usually be about 2/3 of the unbonding time (~2
# weeks) during which they can be financially punished (slashed) for misbehavior.
rpc_servers = "<closest StateSync IP>:26657,<closest StateSync IP>:26657"
trust_height = <return value for the latest block height>
trust_hash = "<return value for the latest block hash>"
```

Start the ZetaChain node:

```bash
zetacored start
```
