## Node Specifications

These are the recommended specs for a ZetaChain node.

| Node Type       | CPU    | Memory       | Data Disk         |
| :-------------- | :----- | :----------- | :---------------- |
| Core Validator  | 4 CPUs | 16 GB Memory | 300+ GB Data Disk |
| Full Node       | 4 CPUs | 12 GB Memory | 300+ GB Data Disk |
| Archive         | 4 CPUs | 12 GB Memory | 3+ TB Data Disk   |

It is recommended to run validators on a machine with NVMe SSDs that support
high IOPS (12K or higher) to avoid falling behind and getting the validator jailed.

## Network Requirements

#### Public Ports

ZetaChain nodes communicate over the following ports. Make sure these are open
to the public internet.

| Node Type               | Port  | Protocol |
| :---------------------- | :---- | :------- |
| Full Node and Validator | 26656 | TCP      |

#### RPC/API/Archive Nodes

If you want to access RPC/API services on your node you'll need to make sure the
following ports are open.

| RPC Type       | Port  | Protocol |
| :------------- | :---  | :------- |
| Tendermint     | 26657 | TCP      |
| EVM RPC - HTTP | 8545  | TCP      |
| EVM RPC - WSS  | 8546  | TCP      |
| Cosmos RPC     | 1317  | TCP      |

#### Operating System

ZetaChain nodes have been developed and tested on x86_64 architecture. Our
binary files have been compiled with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. This guide assumes
you are using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. If you are using a different OS you may
need to make some adjustments.
