title: Gas Fees

## Overview

ZETA is used for gas fees for ZetaChain's EVM, Omnichain Smart Contract
features, and for Cross-Chain Messaging. Fees are distributed to the validator
set proportionally to ZETA staked, and in the future, would be targeted to
distribute across various network participants.

At a high level, fees are bundled for users of ZetaChain dApps, whether they use
cross-chain messaging and/or smart contracts. These fees are distributed to
parties providing value to the network in the form of creating transactions,
securing the network, or other direct protocol contributions. The majority of
fees will go to Validators, becoming a core incentive/reward for contributions
to the network. The network may upgrade to allow a portion of gas fees to be
distributed to a community or developer-kickback pool.
