# Setting Up a Node

In this guide we will be setting up a ZetaChain Mainnet Beta node. For a testnet
node, follow the same instructions, but replace some values (like chain ID and
seed nodes) with the ones provided in corresponding tables.

## Install the ZetaChain Node Binary

First, download the binary and give it executable permissions. Make sure to
replace the `VERSION` with the latest version passed in a
[governance software upgrade proposal](/validators/proposals) and the platform
(`-linux-amd64`) with the one you need.

```
wget https://github.com/zeta-chain/node/releases/download/VERSION/zetacored-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/zetacored

chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/zetacored
```

Check out the GitHub for
[more information on releases](https://github.com/zeta-chain/node/releases).

Check that you have the correct version of `zetacored` installed:

```
zetacored version
```

## Initialize the Data Directory

| Network      | Chain ID         |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Mainnet Beta | zetachain_7000-1 |
| Testnet      | athens_7001-1    |

```
zetacored init MONIKER --chain-id zetachain_7000-1
```

Replace `MONIKER` with a name for your node. By default the node will be
initialized in `$HOME/.zetacored`, but you can customize this with the `--home`
flag.

## Fetch Config Files

| Network      | Config Files                                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet Beta | https://github.com/zeta-chain/network-config/tree/main/mainnet |
| Testnet      | https://github.com/zeta-chain/network-config/tree/main/athens3 |

Fetch and save config files in the data directory:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/genesis.json -O ~/.zetacored/config/genesis.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/client.toml -O ~/.zetacored/config/client.toml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/config.toml -O ~/.zetacored/config/config.toml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/app.toml -O ~/.zetacored/config/app.toml
```

## Modify the Config Files

Even though the config files you fetched in the previous step already contain
all the required values common for all nodes, you will need to make some
adjustments specific to your node.

If your machine has an external IPv4 address you can get it by running the
command in your terminal:

```
curl -4 icanhazip.com

109.68.188.70
```

If you have an IPv6 address, you can use that as an external address.

Replace the moniker and external address with correct values.

```text filename="~/.zetacored/config/config.toml"
moniker = "MONIKER"

[p2p]
external_address = "109.68.188.70:26656"
```

Your node has been configured. Next, choose one of the options to sync your node
with the network.
