title: Vote on a Proposal
---

## Overview

Voting on a proposal is the final step in the governance process. After a
proposal has been submitted and has met the minimum deposit requirement, it
enters the voting period. During this period, network participants can cast
their votes to approve or reject the proposal.

There are four voting options:

- Yes
- No
- No with veto
- Abstain

## Querying a Proposal

Before voting on a proposal, query the proposal to ensure it's in the voting
period.

```
zetacored q gov proposal 58 --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public
```

```yaml
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD
```

## Vote on a Proposal

To vote on a proposal, use the `tx gov vote` command. The command requires the
proposal ID and the voting option.

```
zetacored tx gov vote 58 yes --from alice --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public --chain-id athens_7001-1
```

After the transaction is successfully executed, you can query the proposal to
confirm that your vote has been cast:

```
zetacored q gov votes 58 --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public
```

```yaml
votes:
  - metadata: ""
    options:
      - option: VOTE_OPTION_YES
        weight: "1.000000000000000000"
    proposal_id: "58"
    voter: zeta19nfaqu9wr0fktyyampva98ec025kjy0phww5um
```

## Viewing Voting Results

After the voting is finished, you can query the proposal to view the final tally
result:

```
zetacored q gov proposal 58 --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public
```

```yaml
final_tally_result:
  abstain_count: "21345"
  no_count: "453453"
  no_with_veto_count: "678"
  yes_count: "1230180973026531211265609"
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED
```
