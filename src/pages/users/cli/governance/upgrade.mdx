title: Software Upgrade Proposal

A software upgrade proposal enables network participants to agree on updates to
the node software, which can include improvements to functionality, security,
and performance.

The `contents` field contains the details of the proposal, including the title,
description and the upgrade plan.

Upgrade plan specifies the height at which the upgrade will be executed, the
upgrade name, and the URLs to the upgrade binaries.

Note that if the upgrade proposal passes, the blockchain will halt at the
specified height, so itâ€™s important for node operators to configure their
infrastructure to be ready for the upgrade at the specified height.
