These activities are not just static tasks; they are thoughtfully crafted by
projects within the ZetaChain ecosystem. Each project has the flexibility to
design activities that align with their unique features, user growth strategies,
and overall objectives. For example, a decentralized exchange (DEX) app might
set a minimum trade amount to foster higher trading volumes and active user
participation.

ZetaHub collaborates with the community and app developers to establish a fair
and comprehensive system for determining XP allocation for each activity. This
system takes into account various factors, including the cost and time required
to complete an activity, the period it is featured, and the specific ZetaChain
features involved. This ensures that the activities are not only rewarding and
engaging for users but also align with the overarching goals of the ZetaChain
ecosystem.
