Staking tokens is a crucial part of participating in the ZetaChain network. By staking your ZETA tokens, you contribute to the network's security and stability, while also earning rewards. This guide will walk you through the process of staking your ZETA tokens using the Keplr extension.

To stake your ZETA tokens, start by opening the Keplr extension and switching to the "Staked" interface:
