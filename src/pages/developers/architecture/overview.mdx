## Overview

At a high level, ZetaChain is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain built on the
Cosmos SDK and Tendermint PBFT consensus engine. As a result, ZetaChain enjoys
fast block time (~5s) and instant finality (no confirmation needed, no
re-organization allowed). The Tendermint PBFT consensus engine has shown to
scale to ~300 nodes in production. With future upgrades with BLS threshold
signatures the number can potentially increase to 1000+. The throughput of
transactions on ZetaChain can potentially reach 100 TPS due to the efficient
Tendermint consensus protocol.

The ZetaChain architecture consists of a distributed network of nodes, often
referred to as validators. Validators act as decentralized observers that reach
consensus on relevant external state and events, and can also update external
chain state via distributed key signing. ZetaChain accomplishes these functions
in a decentralized (without a single point of failure, trustless,
permissionless), transparent, and efficient way.

Contained within each validator is the ZetaCore and ZetaClient. ZetaCore is
responsible for producing the blockchain and maintaining the replicated state
machine. ZetaClient is responsible for observing events on external chains and
signing outbound transactions.

ZetaCore and ZetaClient are bundled together and run by node operators. Anyone
can become a node operator to participate in validation provided that enough
bonds are staked.

## Validators

Validators are comprised of 3 different roles: Basic Validators, Observers, and
TSS signer. Fees from transactions and rewards are distributed to Validators in
return for their service of processing transactions and keeping the network
secure. Observers and TSS Signers scale separately from Basic Validators due to
varying security and bond requirements.

### Basic Validators

ZetaChain uses the Tendermint consensus protocol which is a partially
synchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm. Each validator
node can vote on block proposals with voting power proportional to the staking
coins (ZETA) bonded/delegated. Each validator is identified by its consensus
public key. Validators need to be online all the time, ready to participate in
the constantly growing block production. In exchange for their service,
validators will receive block rewards and transaction fees.

### Observers

Another set of important participants for ZetaChain consensus are the observers
who reach consensus on external chain events and states. The observers watch
externally connected chains for certain relevant transactions/events/states at
particular addresses via their full nodes of external chains.

### TSS Signers

ZetaChain collectively holds standard ECDSA/EdDSA keys for authenticated
interaction with external chains. The keys are distributed among multiple
signers in such a way that only a super majority of them can sign on behalf of
the ZetaChain. Itâ€™s important to ensure that at no time is any single entity or
small fraction of nodes able to sign messages on behalf of ZetaChain on external
chains. The ZetaChain system uses bonded stakes and positive/negative incentives
to ensure economic safety.
