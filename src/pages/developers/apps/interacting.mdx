## Calling a Universal App

To call a universal app and transfer native gas tokens from a connected chain, a
user makes a token transfer transaction to a special address called TSS.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Ethereum ["Ethereum (or other EVM chain)"]
    direction LR
    User("User")
    TSS("TSS Address")
    User -- "ETH and message" --> TSS
  end
  subgraph Bitcoin ["Bitcoin"]
    userBTC("User")
    TSSBTC("TSS Address")
    userBTC -- BTC and message --> TSSBTC
  end
  subgraph ZetaChain
    systemContract("System Contract")
    subgraph universalApp ["Universal App"]
      onCrossChainCall("onCrossChainCall")
    end
    TSS --> systemContract
    TSSBTC --> systemContract
    systemContract --> universalApp
  end
```

To call a universal app and transfer supported ERC-20 tokens from a connected
chain, a user calls the `deposit` method of the ERC-20 custody contract.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Ethereum ["Ethereum (or other EVM chain)"]
    direction LR
    User("User")
    erc20Custody("ERC-20 Custody")
    User -- "ERC-20 and message" --> erc20Custody
  end
  subgraph ZetaChain
    systemContract("System Contract")
    subgraph universalApp ["Universal App"]
      onCrossChainCall("onCrossChainCall")
    end
    erc20Custody --> systemContract
    systemContract --> universalApp
  end
```

Calling a universal app executes the `onCrossChainCall` method.

The message is passed as the `bytes calldata message` argument and can contain
arbitrary data.

Native gas or supported ERC-20 tokens get locked in the TSS address or ERC-20
custody contract on connected chain. `onCrossChainCall` receives representations
of these tokens called [ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20). For example, if you
make a call with 1 ETH on Ethereum, a universal app will receive 1 ZRC-20 ETH.

Advantages:

- Bitcoin support
- Sending messages to a TSS address is cheaper than general message passing
- Does not require deploying contracts on connected chains. For example, a user
  on Ethereum can call a universal app by sending ETH and a message to a TSS
  address.

Limitations:

- ERC-20 custody contract accepts only supported tokens.
- Messages can only be sent to universal apps, not from them.

## Withdrawing ZRC-20 Tokens

Native gas and tokens ERC-20 tokens transferred to a universal app are
represented as ZRC-20 tokens. ZRC-20 extends ERC-20 with a `withdraw` method.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph ZetaChain
    User
    ZRC20("ZRC-20")
  end
  subgraph Ethereum ["Connected chain"]
    TSS
    erc20Custody("ERC-20 Custody")
    Recipient1("Recipient")
    Recipient2("Recipient")
  end
  User -- withdraw --> ZRC20
  ZRC20 --> TSS --> Recipient1
  ZRC20 --> erc20Custody --> Recipient2
```

Call the `withdraw` method to send ZRC-20 tokens back to the chain from which
they originate. The withdrawer must have sufficient tokens to cover the
[withdraw fee](/developers/evm/gas).

## Sending Messages to/from a Universal App

To send a message to or from a universal app you can also use a connector API.
Connector is an API that offers two features:

- General message passing to and from universal apps
- Transfer of ZETA tokens to and from universal apps

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph ZetaChain ["ZetaChain"]
    direction LR
    subgraph universalApp ["Universal App"]
      onZetaMessage("onZetaMessage")
    end
    connector("Connector")
    universalApp -- "ZETA and message" --> connector
  end
  subgraph connectedChain ["Connected chain"]
    TSS
    Contract("Contract")
    connector --> TSS
    TSS --> Contract
  end
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph connectedChain ["Connected chain"]
    direction LR
    Contract("Contract")
    connector("Connector")
    Contract -- "ZETA and message" --> connector
  end
  subgraph ZetaChain ["ZetaChain"]
    systemContract("System Contract")
    subgraph universalApp ["Universal App"]
      onZetaMessage("onZetaMessage")
    end
    connector --> systemContract
    systemContract --> universalApp
  end
```

Advantages:

- Messages can be sent to and from universal apps
- Messages can be sent between messaging contracts on connected chains. For
  example, a messaging contract on Ethereum can send a message to a contract on
  BNB chain.

Limitations:

- Contracts need to be deployed on connected chains to receive and send messages

## Summary

- Universal apps are contracts deployed on ZetaChain's EVM that can accept
  contract calls, messages and token transfers from connected chains.
- Universal apps can contract calls, and make token transfers on connected
  chains.
- A universal app can be implemented as a single contract on ZetaChain. You
  don't need to have contracts on all connected chains.
- You can use the connector API for general message passing to and from
  universal apps.
