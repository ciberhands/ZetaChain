# Start building with ZetaChain

At a high level, ZetaChain is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain developed using
the Cosmos SDK and Comet BFT consensus engine. As a result, ZetaChain enjoys
fast block time and instant finality.

ZetaChain hosts an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible execution layer
called the Universal EVM. In addition to supporting all EVM features and
standard interactions (such as contract creation, contract interaction, and
contract composition), ZetaChain's EVM is connected to the Chain Abstraction
Framework (CAF), which enables omnichain connectivity of the network to any
blockchain.

Thanks to CAF, ZetaChain's EVM can be called from any chain, manage
native assets on any chain, and access asynchronous arbitrary messaging to call
contracts on other chains. Developing with the CAF offers the ability to build
robust state management combined with multi-leg, multi-chain apps' needs, all in
the familiar EVM development environment.

ZetaChain offers two ways to develop dApps: **omnichain contracts** and
**cross-chain message passing**.

## Omnichain Contracts

With [omnichain contracts](/developers/omnichain/overview) you deploy **a single
omnichain contract** to ZetaChain.

Omnichain contracts can:

- Accept deposits from users on connected chains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart
  Chain, Bitcoin). A deposit may contain:
  - a native gas or supported ERC-20 token. Tokens (both gas and ERC-20) are
    deposited into omnichain contracts as
    [ZRC-20 tokens](/developers/tokens/zrc20).
  - a message with an arbitrary data.
- Execute logic based on the deposits
- Create outbound transactions to withdraw ZRC-20 to connected chains as native
  assets. A single omnichain contract call can result in multiple outbound
  transactions to different chains.

Ability to accept inputs (native gas, supported ERC-20, and arbitrary data) from
users on connected chains, execute custom logic and create outputs (tokens
withdrawals) to connected chains makes ZetaChain omnichain contracts a powerful
tool for building interoperable apps that span multiple chains.

### Advantages of omnichain contracts

Developers can extend common applications like Uniswap V2/V3, Curve, Aave, and
Compound by making them compatible with ZRC-20. These applications have been
audited and battle-tested on Ethereum and can easily be deployed and built on
ZetaChain. The changes required to add ZRC-20 support are minimal, and users may
interact with these applications in single-step transactions just as they would
on Ethereum.

ZRC-20 can easily support Bitcoin/Dogecoin which do not have capability or
efficiency to support general purpose smart contracts for applications like
swapping, lending, etc.

ZRC-20 may cost significantly less gas than message passing in many use cases
because its interactions with foreign chains are confined to fungible coins
(standard value transfer of ETH/BNB/MATIC costs 21k gas, moving ERC20 tokens
costs around 60k gas; no logic/state on foreign chains means much less gas).

With omnichain smart contracts, you can pair and trade native asset liquidity
directly against each other. This minimizes steps to trade native assets in a
single step, and it doesn't involve a bridge or wrapping step or sending complex
messages. For example, you could trade Ethereum ETH directly for Polygon USDC
through a unified pool in a single transaction.

With ZRC-20/zEVM, exception/revert handling is much simpler as foreign
interaction is confined to either a standard ERC-20/contract interaction
(success) or no contract interaction (failure) immediately.

## Cross-Chain Message Passing

With
[cross-chain message (CCM) passing](/developers/cross-chain-messaging/overview)
you deploy **CCM-enabled contracts on connected chains** that can pass arbitrary
message data and value between each other.

On a connected chain a user can call a CCM-enabled contract. The contract calls
the Connector API and sends a message. ZetaChain acts as a relayer and transmits
the message to the destination chain. On the destination chain a CCM-enabled
contract uses the Connector API to receive the message and handles it.

The state is stored on a set of CCM-enabled contracts on different chains.

CCM makes sense for applications that only need unidirectional and asynchronous
logic/effects and that don't need or benefit from a unified state.

### Advantages of cross-chain message passing

CCM supports any type of data transfer and it's up to the contracts to decide
how to handle the data.

CCM is a reliable general purpose solution for augmenting existing applications
with cross-chain functionality.

With messages, you can leverage existing liquidity like Uniswap pools on
existing chains, and trade via burning/minting ZETA through ZetaChain. This
approach may be more complex (more transactions involved, more gas), but doesn't
rely on liquidity within ZetaChain's ecosystem.

By leveraging the ZETA burn/mint functionality built into ZetaChain, one can
build value-transfer applications that don't bridge/wrap assets, minimizing risk
for users.
