# Universal App Template

ZetaChain comes with [a smart contract
template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template) that makes it easy to get
started building dapps.

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/template
```

The template uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to compile, test, and deploy
contracts. It also imports
[`@zetachain/toolkit`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/toolkit/) that provides a
useful set of utilities for creating contracts, querying balances, tracking
cross-chain transactions, accessing the faucet, and more. The template exposes
most of the features available in the toolkit through Hardhat tasks.

## Generating a Random Wallet

To generate a random wallet:

```
npx hardhat account --save
```

This command generates a random wallet, prints information about the wallet to
the terminal, and saves the private key to a `.env` file to make it accessible
to Hardhat. If you don't want to save the wallet (for example, if you just need
an address to send tokens to for testing purposes), you can run the command
without the `--save` flag.

If you already have a private key or a mnemonic you want to import, you can use
the `--recover` flag:

```
npx hardhat account --save --recover
```

The `account` command will prompt you for a private key or a mnemonic, print the
derived addresses and save the private key into the `.env` file.

The `account` command shows derived addresses in hexacecimal (for EVM-based
chains), bech32 with `zeta` prefix for ZetaChain, and bech32 for Bitcoin.

## Querying for Token Balances

To query for token balances:

```
npx hardhat balances
```

This command queries token balances for the account address derived from the
private key specified in the `.env`.

If you need to query for balances as part of a script, you can also use a
`--json` flag to output the balances in JSON format:

```
npx hardhat balances --json
```

If you want to query for token balances for a different account, you can use the
`--address` flag:

```
npx hardhat balances --address ADDRESS
```

The `balances` command supports querying for native gas tokens, wrapped ZETA on
all connected chains as well as ZetaChain, ZRC-20 tokens, and BTC on Bitcoin.

## Requesting Tokens from the Faucet

To request ZETA tokens from the faucet:

```
npx hardhat faucet
```

This command requests tokens from the faucet for the account address derived
from the private key specified in the `.env`. Tokens sent to the address on
ZetaChain.

You can specify a different address to send the tokens to:

```
npx hardhat faucet --address ADDRESS
```

Alternatively, you can install a standalone faucet CLI:

```
yarn global add @zetachain/faucet-cli
```

You can then use it with the following command:

```
zetafaucet -h
```

## Creating an Omnichain Contract

The template includes a set of commands for generating code for smart contracts
and helper tasks.

To create a new omnichain contract:

```
npx hardhat omnichain MyContract
```

This command creates a new omnichain contract in `contracts/MyContract.sol`, a
task to deploy the contract in `tasks/deploy.ts`, and a task to interact with
the contract in `tasks/interact.ts`.

When an omnichain contract is called, it can receive data in the `data` field of
a transaction. This data is passed to the `message` parameter of the contract's
`onCrossChainCall` function. To specify the fields of the `message` parameter,
use positional arguments:

```
npx hardhat omnichain MyContract recepient:address description quantity:uint256
```

A field may have a type specified after the field name, separated by a colon. If
no type is specified, the type defaults to `string`.

Supported types are: `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, `string`,
`int`,`int8`,`int16`,`int128`,`int256`,`uint`,`uint8`,`uint16`,`uint128`,`uint256`.

Learn more about omnichain contracts by following the
[tutorials](/developers/tutorials/hello/).

## Creating a Cross-Chain Messaging Contract

To create a new cross-chain messaging contract:

```
npx hardhat messaging MyContract
```

This command creates a new cross-chain messaging contract in
`contracts/MyContract.sol`, a task to deploy the contract in `tasks/deploy.ts`,
and a task to interact with the contract in `tasks/interact.ts`.

You can pass additional optional arguments to the `messaging` command to specify
the data that will be sent in the message.

```
npx hardhat messaging MyContract token:uint256 sender:address to:address description
```

A field may have a type specified after the field name, separated by a colon. If
no type is specified, the type defaults to `string`.

The list of supported types is the same as for omnichain contracts.

Learn more about cross-chain messaging by following the
[tutorials](/developers/tutorials/hello).

## Tracking a Cross-Chain Transaction

After broadcasting a cross-chain transaction on a connected chain either to a
cross-chain messaging contract or to trigger an omnichain contract, you can
track its status:

```
npx hardhat cctx TX_HASH
```

## Querying Cross-Chain Fees

To query cross-chain fees:

```
npx hardhat fees
```

This command will query the latest omnichain withdrawal fees as well as
cross-chain messaging fees.

To calculate the fees for a different gas limit use the `--gas` flag:

```
npx hardhat fees --gas 300000
```
