# Swap

## Overview

In this tutorial you will write a cross-chain swap contract that allows users to
swap a native gas or ERC-20 token from one of the connected chains for a token
on another chain.

The swap process involves depositing a token from a connected chain to
ZetaChain, triggering a swap omnichain contract to swap between ZRC-20
representations of the tokens and then withdrawing the swapped token to the
recipient address on the destination chain.

## Set Up Your Environment

Clone the Hardhat contract template:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/template
```

Install dependencies:

```
cd template
yarn
```

## Create the contract

Run the following command to create a new omnichain contract called `Swap`.

```
npx hardhat omnichain Swap targetToken:address recipient
```

                (address, bytes)
            );
            targetTokenAddress = targetToken;
            recipientAddress = recipient;
        }

        (address gasZRC20, uint256 gasFee) = IZRC20(targetTokenAddress)
            .withdrawGasFee();

        uint256 inputForGas = SwapHelperLib.swapTokensForExactTokens(
            systemContract,
            zrc20,
            gasFee,
            gasZRC20,
            amount
        );

        uint256 outputAmount = SwapHelperLib.swapExactTokensForTokens(
            systemContract,
            zrc20,
            amount - inputForGas,
            targetTokenAddress,
            0
        );

        IZRC20(gasZRC20).approve(targetTokenAddress, gasFee);
        IZRC20(targetTokenAddress).withdraw(recipientAddress, outputAmount);
    }
}
```

The contract expects to receive two values in the `message`:

- `address targetTokenAddress`: the address of the ZRC-20 version of the
  destination token.
- `bytes memory recipientAddress`: the recipient address on the destination
  chain. We're using `bytes`, because the recipient address can be either on an
  EVM chain or Bitcoin.

When the contract is called from an EVM chain, the `message` is encoded as a
`bytes` array using the ABI encoding.

When the contract is called from Bitcoin it's up to us to encode and then decode
the message.

Use `context.chainID` to determine the connected chain from which the contract
is called.

If it's Bitcoin, the first 20 bytes of the `message` are the
`targetTokenAddress` encoded as an `address`. Use `bytesToAddress` helper method
to get the target token address. To get the recipient address, use the same
helper method with an offset of 20 bytes and then use `abi.encodePacked` to
convert the address to `bytes`.

If it's an EVM chain, use `abi.decode` to decode the `message` into the
`targetToken` and `recipient` variables.

Next, get the gas fee and the gas coin address from the target token. The gas
coin is the token that will be used to pay for the gas on the destination chain.

Use the `SwapHelperLib.swapTokensForExactTokens` helper method to swap the
incoming token for the gas coin using the internal liquidity pools. The method
returns the amount of the incoming token that was used to pay for the gas.

Next, swap the incoming amount minus the amount spent swapping for a gas fee for
the target token on the destination chain using the `SwapHelperLib._doSwap`
helper method.

Finally, withdraw the tokens to the recipient address on the destination chain.

## Update the Interact Task

In the `interact` task generated for us by the contract template the recipient
is encoded as string. Our contract, however, expects the recipient to be encoded
as `bytes` to ensure that both EVM and Bitcoin addresses are supported.

To support both EVM and Bitcoin addresses, we need to check if the recipient is
a valid Bitcoin address. If it is, we need to encode it as `bytes` using
`utils.solidityPack`.

If it's not a valid bech32 address, then we assume it's an EVM address and use
`args.recipient` as the value for the recipient.

Finally, update the `prepareData` function call to use the `bytes` type for the
recipient.

```ts filename="tasks/interact.ts" {1,6-22}
import bech32 from "bech32";

const main = async (args: any, hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  let recipient;
  try {
    if (bech32.decode(args.recipient)) {
      recipient = utils.solidityPack(
        ["bytes"],
        [utils.toUtf8Bytes(args.recipient)]
      );
    }
  } catch (e) {
    recipient = args.recipient;
  }

  const data = prepareData(
    args.contract,
    ["address", "bytes"],
    [args.targetToken, recipient]
  );
  //...
}
```

## Create an Account and Request Tokens from the Faucet

Before proceeding with the next steps, make sure you have
[created an account and requested ZETA tokens](/developers/omnichain/tutorials/hello#create-an-account)
from the faucet.

## Compile and Deploy the Contract

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

```
npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet
```

## Swap Native Gas Tokens Between EVM Chains

Use the `interact` task to perform a cross-chain swap. In this example, we're
swapping native sETH from Sepolia for tMATIC on Polygon Mumbai. The contract
will deposit sETH to ZetaChain as ZRC-20, swap it for ZRC-20 tMATIC and then
withdraw native tMATIC Polygon Mumbai. To get the value of the `--target-token`
find the ZRC-20 contract address of the destination token in the
[ZRC-20 section of the docs](/developers/tokens/zrc20).

```
npx hardhat interact --contract 0xf6CDd83AB44E4d947FE52c2637ee4A04F330328E --amount 0.01 --network sepolia_testnet --target-token 0x48f80608B672DC30DC7e3dbBd0343c5F02C738Eb --recipient 0x2cD3D070aE1BD365909dD859d29F387AA96911e1

## Swap ERC-20 Tokens Between EVM Chains

Now let's swap USDC from Sepolia to MATIC on Polygon Mumbai. To send USDC
specify the ERC-20 token contract address (on Sepolia) in the `--token`
parameter. You can find the address of the token in the
[ZRC-20 section of the docs](/developers/tokens/zrc20).

```
npx hardhat interact --contract 0xf6CDd83AB44E4d947FE52c2637ee4A04F330328E --amount 10 --token 0x07865c6e87b9f70255377e024ace6630c1eaa37f --network sepolia_testnet --target-token 0x48f80608B672DC30DC7e3dbBd0343c5F02C738Eb --recipient 0x2cD3D070aE1BD365909dD859d29F387AA96911e1

## Swap from Bitcoin

Use the `send-btc` task to send Bitcoin to the TSS address with a memo. The memo
should contain the following:

- Omnichain contract address on ZetaChain:
  `f6CDd83AB44E4d947FE52c2637ee4A04F330328E`
- Target token address: `48f80608B672DC30DC7e3dbBd0343c5F02C738Eb`
- Recipient address: `2cD3D070aE1BD365909dD859d29F387AA96911e1`

```
