title: Cross-Chain ZETA Transfer
---

## Overview

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a contract capable of sending ZETA
tokens between contracts on connected chains using cross-chain messaging.

- This tutorial uses ZetaChain cross-chain messaging, but in this example we're
  only sending ZETA. You will learn how to send arbitrary data in a message in
  the [Message](/developers/tutorials/message) tutorial.
- Since this contract's purpose is to send ZETA, the contract in this example
  will accept ZETA as input. Example contracts in other tutorials will use
  native gas assets as input for convenience.
- All the code will be generated for you by the template.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18 or above)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Set up your environment

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/template
cd template
yarn
```

## Create the Contract

To create a new cross-chain messaging contract you will use the `messaging`
Hardhat task available by default in the template.

```
npx hardhat messaging CrossChainZETA --fees zeta
```

The `messaging` task accepts one or more arguments: the name of the contract and
a list of arguments (optionally with types). The arguments define the contents
of the message that will be sent across chains. In this example the contract
will only be sending ZETA, so the list of arguments is empty.

Use the `--fee zeta` to specify that this contract will be accepting ZETA
tokens. You will learn more about this flag later in this tutorial.

The `messaging` task has created:

- `contracts/CrossChainMessage.sol`: a Solidity cross-chain messaging contract
- `tasks/deploy.ts`: a Hardhat task to deploy the contract on one or more chains
- `tasks/interact.ts`: a Hardhat task to interact with the contract

It also modified `hardhat.config.ts` to import both `deploy` and `interact`
tasks.

Let's review the contract:

```solidity filename="contracts/CrossChainZeta.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/evm/tools/ZetaInteractor.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/evm/interfaces/ZetaInterfaces.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/evm/Zeta.eth.sol";

contract CrossChainZeta is ZetaInteractor {
    error ErrorTransferringZeta();

    event CrossChainZetaEvent();
    event CrossChainZetaRevertedEvent();

    IERC20 internal immutable _zetaToken;

    constructor(address connectorAddress, address zetaTokenAddress) ZetaInteractor(connectorAddress) {
        _zetaToken = IERC20(zetaTokenAddress);
    }

    function sendMessage(uint256 destinationChainId, uint256 zetaValueAndGas) external payable {
        if (!_isValidChainId(destinationChainId))
            revert InvalidDestinationChainId();

        bool success1 = _zetaToken.approve(address(connector), zetaValueAndGas);
        bool success2 = _zetaToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), zetaValueAndGas);
        if (!(success1 && success2)) revert ErrorTransferringZeta();

        connector.send(
            ZetaInterfaces.SendInput({
                destinationChainId: destinationChainId,
                destinationAddress: interactorsByChainId[destinationChainId],
                destinationGasLimit: 300000,
                message: abi.encode(),
                zetaValueAndGas: zetaValueAndGas,
                zetaParams: abi.encode("")
            })
        );
    }
}
```

The contract:

- inherits from
  [`ZetaInteractor`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/evm/tools/ZetaInteractor.sol),
  which provides the connector functionality and helper functions like
  `_isValidChainId`.

State Variables:

- `_zetaToken`: an internal immutable state variable that stores the address of
  the ZETA token contract.

The constructor passes `connectorAddress` to the `ZetaInteractor` constructor
and initializes the `_zetaToken` state variables.

The `sendMessage` function is used to send ZETA tokens to a recipient contract
on the destination chain. It first checks that the destination chain ID is
valid. Then it approves the contract to spend an amount of ZETA

## Cross-Chain Fees

[Cross-chain messaging fees](/developers/evm/gas/#cross-chain-messaging-fees) are
paid in ZETA tokens. This is convenient if the caller has ZETA tokens on the
source chain. However, many users might only have native gas tokens. In this
case it's more convenient for a contract to accept native gas token, and swap it
for ZETA.

To choose which token your contract accepts, use the `--fees` flag.

To make the contract accept ZETA, use `--fees zeta`. This value was used to
create a contract above. Since the contract's only purpose is to send ZETA, it
makes sense to also accept ZETA as a fee token.

To make the contract accept native gas tokens, use `--fees native` or skip this
flag completely as this is the default option.

## Sending ZETA

The `sendMessage` function uses `connector.send` to send a crosss-chain message
with the following arguments wrapped in a struct:

- `destinationChainId`: chain ID of the destination chain
- `destinationAddress`: address of the contract receiving the message on the
  destination chain (expressed in bytes since it can be non-EVM)
- `destinationGasLimit`: gas limit for the destination chain's transaction
- `message`: arbitrary message to be parsed by the receiving contract on the
  destination chain. In this example it's empty as we're only sending ZETA, not
  arbitrary data.
- `zetaValueAndGas`: amount of ZETA tokens to be sent to the destination chain,
  ZetaChain gas fees, and destination chain gas fees (expressed in ZETA tokens)
- `zetaParams`: optional ZetaChain parameters. Currently, not being used.

After handling the fees the contract calls `connector.send` to send
`zetaValueAndGas` amount of ZETA to the `destinationAddress` contract on the
`destinationChainId` blockchain. The message is empty as only ZETA tokens are
being transferred.

## Deploy Task

The `messaging` task has created a Hardhat task to deploy the contract.

```ts filename="tasks/deploy.ts"
import { getAddress } from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { task, types } from "hardhat/config";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import type { ParamChainName } from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts";

const contractName = "CrossChainZeta";

const main = async (args: any, hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const networks = args.networks.split(",");
  const contracts: { [key: string]: string } = {};
  await Promise.all(
    networks.map(async (networkName: ParamChainName) => {
      contracts[networkName] = await deployContract(hre, networkName, args.json, args.gasLimit);
    })
  );

  for (const source in contracts) {
    await setInteractors(hre, source as ParamChainName, contracts, args.json, args.gasLimit);
  }

  if (args.json) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(contracts, null, 2));
  }
};

const initWallet = (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment, networkName: ParamChainName) => {
  const { url } = hre.config.networks[networkName] as any;
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(url);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string, provider);

  return wallet;
};

const deployContract = async (
  hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment,
  networkName: ParamChainName,
  json: boolean = false,
  gasLimit: number
) => {
  const wallet = initWallet(hre, networkName);

  const connector = getAddress("connector", networkName);
  const zetaToken = getAddress("zetaToken", networkName);

  const { abi, bytecode } = await hre.artifacts.readArtifact(contractName);
  const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, wallet);
  const contract = await factory.deploy(connector, zetaToken, { gasLimit });

  await contract.deployed();
  if (!json) {
    console.log(`
🚀 Successfully deployed contract on ${networkName}
📜 Contract address: ${contract.address}`);
  }
  return contract.address;
};

const setInteractors = async (
  hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment,
  source: ParamChainName,
  contracts: { [key: string]: string },
  json: boolean = false,
  gasLimit: number
) => {
  if (!json) {
    console.log(`
🔗 Setting interactors for a contract on ${source}`);
  }
  const wallet = initWallet(hre, source);

  const { abi, bytecode } = await hre.artifacts.readArtifact(contractName);
  const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, wallet);
  const contract = factory.attach(contracts[source]);

  for (const counterparty in contracts) {
    if (counterparty === source) continue;

    const counterpartyContract = ethers.utils.solidityPack(["address"], [contracts[counterparty]]);
    const chainId = hre.config.networks[counterparty].chainId;
    await (
      await contract.setInteractorByChainId(chainId, counterpartyContract, {
        gasLimit,
      })
    ).wait();
    if (!json) {
      console.log(`✅ Interactor address for ${chainId} (${counterparty}) is set to ${counterpartyContract}`);
    }
  }
};

task("deploy", "Deploy the contract", main)
  .addParam("networks", "Comma separated list of networks to deploy to")
  .addOptionalParam("gasLimit", "Gas limit", 10000000, types.int)
  .addFlag("json", "Output JSON");
```

To establish cross-chain messaging between blockchains via ZetaChain, you need
to deploy contracts capable of sending and receiving cross-chain messages to two
or more blockchains connected to ZetaChain.

You can specify the desired chains by using a `--networks` parameter of the
`deploy` task, which accepts a list of network names separated by commas. For
instance, `--networks sepolia_testnet,bsc_testnet`.

The `main` function maintains a mapping of network names to their corresponding
deployed contract addresses, iterating over the networks to deploy the contract
on each one.

The contract's constructor requires three arguments: the connector contract's
address, the ZETA token's address, and the ZETA token consumer contract's
address. These addresses are obtained using ZetaChain's `getAddress`.

The `main` function subsequently sets interactors for each contract. An
interactor is a mapping between a chain ID of the destination and the contract
address on that chain.

When deploying to two chains (like Sepolia and BSC testnet), you will invoke
`setInteractorByChainId` on a Sepolia contract and pass the BSC testnet chain ID
(97) and the BSC testnet contract address. You then perform the same operation
on a BSC testnet contract, passing the Sepolia chain ID (11155111) and the
Sepolia contract address. If deploying to more than two chains, you must call
`setInteractorByChainId` for each link between the chains.

## Interact Task

The `messaging` task has also created a Hardhat task to interact with the
contract:

```ts filename="tasks/interact.ts"
import { task } from "hardhat/config";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { parseEther } from "@ethersproject/units";
import { getAddress } from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts";

const main = async (args: any, hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  const factory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("CrossChainZeta");
  const contract = factory.attach(args.contract);

  const destination = hre.config.networks[args.destination]?.chainId;
  if (destination === undefined) {
    throw new Error(`${args.destination} is not a valid destination chain`);
  }

  const value = parseEther(args.amount);

  const zetaTokenAddress = getAddress("zetaToken", hre.network.name as any);
  const zetaFactory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ZetaEth");
  const zetaToken = zetaFactory.attach(zetaTokenAddress);

  await (await zetaToken.approve(args.contract, value)).wait();

  const tx = await contract.connect(signer).sendMessage(destination, value);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  if (args.json) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(tx, null, 2));
  } else {
    console.log(`🔑 Using account: ${signer.address}\n`);
    console.log(`✅ The transaction has been broadcasted to ${hre.network.name}
📝 Transaction hash: ${receipt.transactionHash}
`);
  }
};

task("interact", "Sends a message from one chain to another.", main)
  .addFlag("json", "Output JSON")
  .addParam("contract", "Contract address")
  .addParam("amount", "Token amount to send")
  .addParam("destination", "Destination chain");
```

The task accepts the following arguments:

- `contract`: address of the contract on the source chain
- `amount`: amount of native tokens to send with the transaction
- `destination`: name of the destination chain

The `main` function uses the `contract` argument to attach to the contract on
the source chain. It then uses the `destination` argument to obtain the
destination chain's chain ID. The function subsequently calls the `sendMessage`
contract method passing `destination` and `value`.

## Deploy the Contract

Clear the cache and artifacts, then compile the contract:

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

Run the following command to deploy the contract to two networks:

```
npx hardhat deploy --networks sepolia_testnet,bsc_testnet
```

```

## Send ZETA

Run the following command to send ZETA tokens from Sepolia to BSC testnet.
Please, note that since the contract expect ZETA tokens as fees, the value of
the `--amount` param is denominated in ZETA tokens. A fraction of the amount
will be deducted as a cross-chain fee, the rest will be sent to the recipient on
the destination chain.

```
npx hardhat interact --contract 0xDEB42ce9d2F32caaA38Bf3107a054951E11575DF --network sepolia_testnet --amount 3 --destination bsc_testnet
```
