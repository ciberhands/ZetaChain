title: Swap To Any Token
---

In the previous [Swap](/developers/tutorials/swap) tutorial, you learned how to
create universal swap contracts that enable users to exchange tokens from one
connected blockchain for a token on another blockchain, with the target token
always withdrawn to the destination chain.

In this tutorial, you will enhance the swap contract to support swapping tokens
to any token (such as ZRC-20, ERC-20, or ZETA) and provide the flexibility to
either withdraw the token to the destination chain or keep it on ZetaChain.

Keeping swapped tokens on ZetaChain is useful if you want to use ZRC-20 in
non-universal contracts that don't yet have the capacity to accept tokens from
connected chains directly, or if the destination token is ZETA, which you want
to keep on ZetaChain.

## Omnichain Contract

Copy the existing swap example into a new file `SwapToAnyToken.sol` and make the
necessary changes:

    }
}
```

Add the `WZETA` interface import, which allows interacting with ERC-20
compatible tokens (such as ZRC-20) as well as unwrapping WZETA into native ZETA.

Change the contract name from `Swap` to `SwapToAnyToken`.

Add `bool withdraw` to the `Params` struct. This value determines if a user
wants to withdraw the swapped token to the destination chain (`true`) or keep
the token on ZetaChain (`false`). By default the value will be set to `true`.

If the contract is being called from Bitcoin, use `bytesToBool` to decode the
last value in the `message`, and set it as the value of `params.withdraw`.

If the contract is being called from an EVM chain, use `abi.decode` to decode
all values: target token, recipient and the withdraw flag.

Next, add `params.withdraw` as the last argument to the `swapAndWithdraw`
function call.

### Swap and Withdraw Function

Add `bool withdraw` as the last parameter to the function definition.

If a user wants to withdraw the tokens, query the gas token and the gas fee.
Since a user now has an option to not withdraw, this step has become optional.

Modify the amount passed to `swapExactTokensForTokens`. If a user withdraws
token, subtract the withdraw fee in input token amount.

Finally, add a conditional to either withdraw ZRC-20 tokens to a connected chain
or transfer the target token to the recipient on ZetaChain. If a user doesn't
want to withdraw a token you need to consider two scenarios:

- If the target token is WZETA, unwrap it and transfer native ZETA to the
  recipient.
- If the target token is not WZETA, transfer it to the recipient as any other
  ERC-20-compatible token.

### Swap Function

Create a new public `swap` function to make it possible for users to call the
"swap and withdraw" function. Compared to "swap and withdraw", which is internal
and is not meant to be called directly, the "swap" function is public and is
meant to be called from ZetaChain. The purpose of "swap" is to allow users to
swap tokens they have on ZetaChain for other tokens and optionally also withdraw
them. For example, when a user has a ZRC-20 ETH and they want to swap it for
ZRC-20 BTC (without withdrawing), or swap it for ZRC-20 BNB and withdraw it to
the BNB chain as a native BNB token.

## Update the Interact Task

```ts filename="tasks/interact.ts"
let withdraw = true;
if (args.withdraw != undefined) {
  withdraw = JSON.parse(args.withdraw);
}

const data = prepareData(args.contract, ["address", "bytes", "bool"], [args.targetToken, recipient, withdraw]);

//...
  .addOptionalParam("withdraw");
```

Add an optional parameter `withdraw`, which determines if a user wants to
withdraw the target token to the destination chain. By default set the value to
`true`, and pass withdraw as the third value in the message.

## Add a Swap Task

While the interact task is meant to be called on a connected chain to trigger a
universal contract, the swap task is meant to be called on ZetaChain directly to
swap an asset already on ZetaChain for a different asset optionally withdrawing
it.

```
import { task } from "hardhat/config";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { parseEther } from "@ethersproject/units";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const main = async (args: any, hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  if (!/zeta_(testnet|mainnet)/.test(hre.network.name)) {
    throw new Error('🚨 Please use either "zeta_testnet" or "zeta_mainnet".');
  }

  const factory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("SwapToAnyToken");
  const contract = factory.attach(args.contract);

  const amount = parseEther(args.amount);
  const inputToken = args.inputToken;
  const targetToken = args.targetToken;
  const recipient = ethers.utils.arrayify(args.recipient);
  const withdraw = JSON.parse(args.withdraw);

  const erc20Factory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20");
  const inputTokenContract = erc20Factory.attach(args.inputToken);

  const approval = await inputTokenContract.approve(args.contract, amount);
  await approval.wait();

  const tx = await contract.swap(
    inputToken,
    amount,
    targetToken,
    recipient,
    withdraw
  );

  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`);
};

task("swap", "Interact with the Swap contract from ZetaChain", main)
  .addFlag("json", "Output JSON")
  .addParam("contract", "Contract address")
  .addParam("amount", "Token amount to send")
  .addParam("inputToken", "Input token address")
  .addParam("targetToken", "Target token address")
  .addParam("recipient", "Recipient address")
  .addParam("withdraw", "Withdraw flag (true/false)");
```

## Compile and Deploy the Contract

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

When deploying use the `--name` flag to specify which contract you want to
deploy:

```
npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet --name SwapToZeta
```

```

## Swap Tokens Without Withdrawing

When using the `interact` task specify ZETA token contract address as the value
of `--target-token`:

```
npx hardhat interact --contract 0x1767A93A96D339EeC8E0325D94B5d3E4454d542f --network bsc_testnet --amount 0.01 --target-token 0xcC683A782f4B30c138787CB5576a86AF66fdc31d --recipient 0x6093537Aa6C8C8bf4705bda40aC9193977208B39 --withdraw false
```

Track the transaction:

```
npx hardhat cctx 0x3f22de7a6d6669ce55ce2a95adaee46b8fd8a751b145c903c62300f9e7e44e4d

```

Notice that an outbound CCTX is not created, because when swapping without
withdrawing, target tokens remain on ZetaChain and are not withdrawn.
