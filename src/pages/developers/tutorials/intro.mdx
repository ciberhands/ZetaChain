# Getting Started

This introductory tutorial will guide you through the essential steps to set up
your smart contract template, create and configure your account, and request
tokens for testing on ZetaChain.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like environment (for example, macOS)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18 or above)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Universal App Template

ZetaChain provides [a smart contract
template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template) to help you start building
universal apps quickly. First, clone the template from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/template
```

Next, navigate to the template directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```
cd template/contracts
yarn
```

The template uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for compiling, testing, and
deploying contracts. It also uses
[`@zetachain/toolkit`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/toolkit/), which offers
various utilities for creating contracts, querying balances, tracking
cross-chain transactions, accessing the faucet, and more. The template exposes
most of the features available in the toolkit through Hardhat tasks.

## Create an Account

To interact with a blockchain, you'll need an account. If you don't have an
account, you can generate a new one using the following command:

```
npx hardhat account --save
```

This command creates a random wallet, displays the wallet information in the
terminal, and saves the private key to a `.env` file, making it accessible to
Hardhat.

If you don't want to save the wallet (for example, if you just need an address
to send tokens to for testing purposes), you can run the command without the
`--save` flag.

If you already have a private key or mnemonic, you can import it with the
`--recover` flag:

```
npx hardhat account --save --recover
```

This will prompt you to enter the private key or mnemonic, derive the addresses,
and save the private key into the `.env` file.

The `account` command shows derived addresses in hexadecimal (for EVM-based
chains), bech32 with `zeta` prefix for ZetaChain, and bech32 for Bitcoin.

## Query Token Balances

To check the token balances:

```
npx hardhat balances
```

This command queries token balances for the account address derived from the
private key specified in the `.env`.

If you need to query for balances as part of a script, you can also use a
`--json` flag to output the balances in JSON format:

```
npx hardhat balances --json
```

If you want to query for token balances for a different account, you can use the
`--address` flag:

```
npx hardhat balances --address ADDRESS
```

The `balances` command supports querying for native gas tokens, wrapped ZETA on
all connected chains as well as ZetaChain, ZRC-20 tokens, and BTC on Bitcoin.

## Request Tokens from the Faucet

To request ZETA tokens from the faucet:

```
npx hardhat faucet
```

This command requests tokens from the faucet for the account address derived
from the private key specified in the `.env`. To prevent abuse, the faucet will
prompt you to sign in with GitHub. Once the process is complete, you will
receive native ZETA tokens on ZetaChain testnet. It may take a few minutes for
your request to be processed.

To send tokens to a different address, use:

```
npx hardhat faucet --address ADDRESS
```

Alternatively, you can install a standalone faucet CLI:

```
yarn global add @zetachain/faucet-cli
```

You can then use it with the following command:

```
zetafaucet -h
```

If the faucet is throwing an error, delete the `access_token` file from the
project and try again.

In addition to ZETA tokens on ZetaChain, you might need tokens on connected
blockchains like Ethereun, BNB and Bitcoin testnets.
