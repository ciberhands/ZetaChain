title: Connector
---

The connector contract enables contracts to send messages of arbitrary data and
ZETA tokens between smart contract-enabled connected chains.

| Network      | Connector contract address                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Testnet      | 0x239e96c8f17C85c30100AC26F635Ea15f23E9c67 |
| Mainnet Beta | 0x239e96c8f17C85c30100AC26F635Ea15f23E9c67 |

To create a contract that uses ZetaChain's connector, use:

- `connector.send` to send a message
- implement a `onZetaMessage` function to handle incoming messages
- implement a `onZetaRevert` function to handle reverted messages

You can find in-depth tutorials on how to use connector to send messages in the
"Tutorials" section of the docs:

- [Connector: Send ZETA](/developers/tutorials/zeta)
- [Connector: Messaging](/developers/tutorials/message)
- [Connector: ERC-20](/developers/tutorials/erc20)
- [Connector: NFTs](/developers/tutorials/connector-nft)

Please, note that the connector API is separate from the `onCrossChainCall`
functionality.

A universal app must implement `onCrossChainCall`, but it may also use the
connector API to send and receive messages to and from ZetaChain's Universal
EVM.

- When sending messages to ZetaChain or native gas or supported ERC-20 tokens,
  use `onCrossChainCall`.
- When sending messages from ZetaChain or transferring ZETA, use the connector.
