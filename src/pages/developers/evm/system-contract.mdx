title: System Contract
---

The System Contract on ZetaChain serves as the caller for universal apps when
they are called from connected chains.

| Network      | System contract address                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Testnet      | 0xEdf1c3275d13489aCdC6cD6eD246E72458B8795B |
| Mainnet Beta | 0x91d18e54DAf4F677cB28167158d6dd21F6aB3921 |

The `onlySystem` modifier must be applied to the `onCrossChainCall` function to
ensure that only the system contract can call this function.

Useful values and functions in the system contract:

- `wZetaContractAddress`: wrapped ZETA address.
- `uniswapv2Router02Address`: address of the Uniswap v2 router, which powers the
  internal liquidity pools.
- `uniswapv2FactoryAddress`: address of the Uniswap v2 factory.
- `gasZetaPoolByChainId`: returns a pool address of ZETA and a gas token of the
  specified chain.
- `gasCoinZRC20ByChainId`: returns a ZRC-20 address of the gas token of the
  specified chain.
- `gasPriceByChainId`: helper to estimate gas for transactions on connected
  chains.
- `zetaConnectorZEVMAddress`: address of the connector contract. (please, note
  that the connector contract will be deprecated in the future)

The system contract is inherited from `ZetaChain`, making it easily accessible
from your universal app contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/IZRC20.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol";

contract YourContract is zContract {
    function onCrossChainCall(
        zContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external virtual override {
        // systemContract.gasCoinZRC20ByChainId(context.chainID)
    }
}
```

To get the system contract address in a client-side application or script, use
the `getAddress` function:

```ts
import { getAddress } from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts";

const SYSTEM_CONTRACT = getAddress("systemContract", "zeta_testnet");
```
