# Alchemy

Alchemy is a blockchain development platform that provides tools and
infrastructure to build and scale decentralized applications. As a
developer-focused platform, Alchemy helps companies create scalable and reliable
dApps without the difficulty of managing blockchain infrastructure in-house. It
simplifies the development process by offering a suite of APIs and services that
enable developers to interact with blockchain networks efficiently.

One of Alchemy's standout offerings is the **Alchemy Supernode**, which provides
a reliable and scalable way to connect and build on the ZetaChain blockchain.
This ensures that developers can focus on innovation and functionality without
worrying about the complexities of node management.

**Alchemy's Websockets and Webhooks** features allow developers to subscribe and
get notified for any address activity events, as well as mined and dropped
transactions. This real-time notification system enhances the ability to monitor
and react to blockchain events, further simplifying the development and
maintenance of decentralized applications.

For ZetaChain developers, the **Alchemy SDK** offers the easiest way to connect
their dApps to the blockchain with just two lines of code. This streamlined
approach significantly reduces the time and effort required to integrate
blockchain functionality into applications.

With Alchemy, developers can access real-time blockchain data, manage smart
contracts, and monitor the performance of their dApps across various
blockchains, making it a versatile choice for building robust, scalable, and
secure blockchain-based applications.

## Create a New ZetaChain Project

In the Alchemy dashboard you have an overview of all projects currently set up
in your account. If you're building a universal app on ZetaChain, you might want
to create projects for Ethereum and BNB to have access to RPCs of connected
chains.

Click "Create new app" to create a ZetaChain project.

In the modal window select "ZetaChain" and either "Mainnet" or "Testnet".

## Get the API Key

Interactions with your Alchemy RPC instance are protected by an API key. Click
on the "API key" button to get the key.

## API Key and RPC Endpoints

In the modal window you will see your API key as well as HTTP and WSS RPC
endpoints.

## Connect to Alchemy

If you're starting form scratch, create a new directory and initialize an npm
project:

```
mkdir zetachain-app
cd zetachain-app
npm init -y
```

Use npm to install the Alchemy SDK:

```
npm install alchemy-sdk
```

Create a new Alchemy SDK instance. Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your
actual API key.

```ts
// index.js
import { Network, Alchemy } from "alchemy-sdk";

const settings = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  network: Network.ZETACHAIN_MAINNET,
};

const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

// Get the latest block
const latestBlock = alchemy.core.getBlockNumber();

// Get all outbound transfers for a provided address
alchemy.core.getTokenBalances("0x4955a3F38ff86ae92A914445099caa8eA2B9bA32").then(console.log);

// Listen to all new pending transactions
alchemy.ws.on(
  { method: "alchemy_pendingTransactions", fromAddress: "0x4955a3F38ff86ae92A914445099caa8eA2B9bA32" },
  (res) => console.log(res)
);
```

Run the script with Node.js:

```
node index.js
```
