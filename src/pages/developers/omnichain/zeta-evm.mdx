# ZetaEVM (zEVM)

zEVM is an Ethereum-compatible virtual machine where you can deploy and use
Omnichain Smart Contracts, built on top of ZetaChain's core blockchain.
Contracts on zEVM are connected to ZetaChain's Chain Abstraction Framework (CAF) and are
able to orchestrate assets on external chains as if they were all on a single
chain.

Contracts on zEVM can be called via [ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20) from
external chains. To connect to zEVM directly, check out the network info
